You can’t ski up or down big mountains doing any of those. Ski mountaineering utilizes fast AT setups. What’s an AT setup? AT stands for alpine touring, which means you tour the mountains on your own human power—no ski lifts or snowmobiles—by using AT-specific skis/boots/bindings/skins. The bindings and toe-mechanism on the boots allow for one’s heels to lift up on the way up a mountain. It’s uphill walking on skis. You attach sticky synthetic ‘skins’ to the bottom of your skis, which use the power of physics and friction to prevent you from sliding backwards (most of the time—icy conditions make for difficult, technical skinning).  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_216\\\" style=\\\"width: 2448px\\\">![img_4188](/content/images/2016/12/img_4188.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Free heels on the uphills allow for creativity.

Except not. There was a lot of stoke in 2016, and here’s just a tip of the melting iceberg of a year.  \\n Moved to Boulder and found my trail running tribe. This was after living in Thailand for the majority of the previous two years. Exciting note about Thailand, my Earthraging water-safe and environmental stewardship program for underprivileged Thai students is thriving, without me!  [Check it out.](http://earthraging.org/)  \\n My Dad cajoled me into partnering with him for various [skimo](https://claregallagherruns.wordpress.com/2016/12/24/what-the-heck-is-skimo/) races around Colorado. Little did I know, this would solidify my love for the sport. It also solidified that Team Fueled by Flatulence would never race as a team again. Picture: girl towing Dad. Girl yelling at Dad. Dad hitting tree. Dad breaking pole. Girl waiting for Dad. For hours…etc.  \\n![img_4511](/content/images/2017/01/img_4511.jpg)  \\n Emergency rooms became my 12-hour work haunts. I scribed in ERs in the Denver Metro area. I had medical school aspirations and ERs only solidified my desire to work in medicine, and to work with people. I was constantly learning, laughing, and thinking. Little did I know that I would overhaul my aspirations six months later.  \\n I tutored, and still tutor. Chemistry, math, writing. My tutees rock.  \\n Princeton in Asia invited my Thailand, Earthraging partner, Haley Read and I to return to the annual banquet at Princeton and speak about our program to the Board of Trustees. An honor we’re not soon to forget.  \\n![img_4990](/content/images/2017/01/img_4990.jpg)  \\n Raced Dirty Thirty 50k, in Black Canyon State Park, just outside Boulder, to gear up for summer. Got 2<sup>nd</sup> behind Alicia Shay. I was pleased.  \\n![img_5210](/content/images/2017/01/img_5210.jpg)  \\n Many summer weekends were spent running in the mountains. The Salomon Squad of Boulder runs deep and it was an honor to be an initial member of the Ambassador Program.  \\n![img_5570](/content/images/2017/01/img_5570.jpg)![img_5527](/content/images/2017/01/img_5527.jpg)  \\n HOTSHOT repping. Talked to thousands of people about the neuromuscular workings of the spicy liquid shot that PREVENTS and TREATS cramping. Worked with awesome people who taught me a lot about cramping.  \\n![img_5851](/content/images/2017/01/img_5851.jpg)  \\n Organic Chemistry II. I dropped it within five days. I realized I didn’t want to be a doctor anymore. Anguish, fear, feelings of failure ensued.  \\n    \\n Published coral paper! [This paper ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310481670_Spatial_refugia_mediate_juvenile_coral_survival_during_coral-predator_interactions)was based on research from my senior thesis on baby corals and crevices. This may be my proudest accomplishment of the year, considering I’m completely removed from an academic setting, and have been working with my advisor, [Christopher Doropoulos](http://www.marinespatialecologylab.org/people/christopher-doropoulos/), who lives in Brisbane, Australia, since my junior year at Princeton—4 years ago! Knowing how devastated the Earth’s coral reefs are from the impacts of climate change, I fear an ugly world for future generations. But I also have immense hope that the [U.S. can stick to the Paris Agreement](http://www.businessinsider.com/mayors-could-override-trump-on-paris-accord-2016-11), even if our President doesn’t.  \\n Raced USA 30km Trail Champs in Colorado Spring. Got second behind Megan Roche. Congrats to the fastie for getting [Woman Ultra Runner of the Year](http://trailrunner.com/trail-news/usatf-mountain-ultra-trail-running-council-announces-2016-runners-year/).  \\n![img_5719](/content/images/2017/01/img_5719.jpg)  \\n Raced Aspen Power of Four (25km) and won, barely. Two weeks till Leadville. Heavy legs and heavy heart in anticipation for my first 100-miler.  \\n![img_5837](/content/images/2017/01/img_5837.jpg)  \\n Moved out of the Tiger Den, into Kreith Household. The Tiger Den was an adorable studio apartment that I shared with my former Princeton teammate, Molly Higgins. She ended her career as a professional triathlete as I ended my medical school plans. The Tiger Den went through a lot. I moved into a basement studio of two retired CU Professors, Frank and Marion Kreith. [Frank pretty much invented solar technology](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_30681601/boulder-scientist-frank-kreith-lands-top-engineering-honor). Both of them escaped the Holocaust. I’ve learned a thing or two living there, to say the least.  \\n![img_4796](/content/images/2017/01/img_4796.jpg)  \\n Leadville 100:  Went into the race with the goal of making the podium. Day went exceptionally well, winning and getting the second fastest women’s time ever. Stoked. Couldn’t be more grateful for my dreamteam crew of friends and family.  \\n![img_6074](/content/images/2017/01/img_6074.jpg)  \\n    \\n Raced The North Face Endurance Challenge Half Marathon in Park City. Met idols like Rory Bosio and Rob Krar. Joining The North Face team was a dream and it felt eerily close to reality. I won the half marathon, even with spraining my ankle with two miles to go. GORGEOUS COURSE, even when dropping five F-boms per minute.  \\n![IMG_6214.JPG](/content/images/2017/01/img_6214.jpg)  \\n The North Face Athlete Summit – Dreams do come true. Joining The North Face Team is like putting dynamite in a apple. My mind is constantly blown away by the adventures, feats, and creative energy of TNF athletes. Not to mention that my runner teammates have been my idols for years. It’s even cooler to join a company that values environmental conservation and [puts its money where its mouth is](https://vimeo.com/33834177). I look forward to a long relationship with TNF, in running and environmentalism.  \\n![img_6991](/content/images/2017/01/img_6991.jpg)![img_6583](/content/images/2017/01/img_6583.jpg)![img_6595](/content/images/2017/01/img_6595.jpg)  \\n![img_6686](/content/images/2017/01/img_6686.jpg)  \\n A film crew from [Talweg Creative](http://www.talwegcreative.com/) (REI) followed me around for nine days. What an experience to meet the coolest group of journalists, all of whom write for my fav magazine, [Outside](https://www.outsideonline.com/). We didn’t have any fun at all. Nope, I hogged it all during my cluster of a trail marathon in Moab.  \\n![img_6779](/content/images/2017/01/img_6779.jpg)![img_6775](/content/images/2017/01/img_6775.jpg)  \\n Raced Moab Trail Marathon – Placed 6<sup>th</sup>, not my best day, at all. Maybe I had too much fun with the Talweg film crew…  \\n Thanksgiving and Turkey Trot: Tried to defend my family’s honor in the annual Washington Park Turkey Trot (with > 9,500 runners). Lost to my former Princeton teammate, Abby Levene, who is a professional triathlete in Boulder. A very swallowable loss!  \\n![img_6929](/content/images/2017/01/img_6929.jpg)  \\n Raced The North Face 50-mile Championships in Marin County, California. Good day amongst the redwoods. [Read the recap](https://claregallagherruns.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/tnf50-recap-way-to-bounce-back-from-a-bonk-redwood-humbling/).  \\n![img_7145](/content/images/2017/01/img_7145.jpg)  \\n Raced the Northwest Passage skimo race in Mt. Brundage, Idaho. Got my butt handed to me! DNFed in the vertical race (my only chance at making the Worlds Team) due to a moronic skin choice, i.e. my old skins iced up so much they didn’t stick to my skis and I couldn’t climb up, which is the objective of the race. The following morning, it was -19F and I mustered through the 10.5 mile, 6,000 feet of gain race. The downhills are what tore me apart.

Second, what’s happened since. Third, some very important phone numbers.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_433\\\" style=\\\"width: 2500px\\\">![_dsc8860](/content/images/2017/01/dsc8860.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Photo: @carolinelovesphotos</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n#### The Women’s March\\n\\nFeeling full of hope, yet also full of exhaustion. I’m tired of everything that is unfair, wrong and depressing. My privilege is overwhelming to the point of guilt. I feel empowered, yet paralyzed. I feel swift and strong, yet so insignificant. I sometimes wonder if there’s any point in trying to make change.  \\n Then I remember this awe-inspiring thing called humanity. I remember that I’m a part of it. Like in a bee colony, every bee matters. I’m a worker bee and there’s lots of pollen to collect. Small granules that I’m capable and willing to pick up, to bring back to the hive. Like a hive needs individual pollen granules, humanity needs individuals making small changes of improvement.  \\n For me, it starts with unyielding compassion. Compassion for the people I interact with everyday. Compassion for people who deserve extra love and understanding due to their genetics, their upbringing, their lack of opportunity, their bad luck. Going the extra pollen granule to give someone the benefit of the doubt.  \\n Like the person who needs an extra quarter at the launder mat, who doesn’t speak much English, but hey, THIS IS AMERICA! Who cares if he doesn’t know English in this moment? Give him a quarter because you are both part of this thing called humanity. And the chance that he has had less privilege than you, by complete randomness, is pretty darn high. Let’s all realize that a lot of our success is due to our genes and our upbringing. Think about people’s misfortunes similarly. Often, misfortunes are actually not someone’s personal fault, but due to those random parts of each of us.  \\n We could all exude more compassion for the randomness of humanity. If we all did our part to collect more pollen for the hive, we’d be better off. This means: stand up for those discriminated against on basis of religion, sexuality, ethnicity, wealth, or myriad other reasons; give that quarter to a fellow human; give that $50 to Planned Parenthood; buy less crap you don’t need; use less energy that emits fossil fuels; donate your time locally to those who need your pollen.  \\n Though this should’ve been my biggest goal at the onset of the New Year, it took twenty days and the largest march in history to catalyze these thoughts and to realize now, more than ever, the importance of compassion.\\n\\n#### Forgoing the Passive Route\\n\\nI’m so grateful to be associated with a company like The North Face, who skipped the easy, passive route this weekend. The North Face told its athletes that it supported us if we wanted to march. I was planning on going already, coincidentally (or not) with my TNF teammate, sky running shredder, Hillary Allen and photographer friend Caroline Treadway. The North Face didn’t stop at just support. They posted two photos about the March on their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thenorthface/). The photos showcased support for everything the March stood for: equality for all, climate change mitigation, women’s and minorities’ rights.  \\n![Screen Shot 2017-01-24 at 20.29.49.png](/content/images/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-24-at-20-29-49.png)  \\n Sure, it would’ve been extremely easy for TNF to not post anything about the March. To choose a sweet ski or snowboard photo to amaze and inspire us during these winter months. But no. Those photos come the day before and the day after January 20<sup>th</sup>. On this seminal day, The North Face chose to stand for equality and for what’s right in this increasingly frightening atmosphere. The North Face chose to stand for compassion.  \\n My take on the few comments that opposed these posts is simple: If someone wants to live in a vanilla world where climate change and discrimination against minorities and women doesn’t exist, then by all means, I encourage the search for that vanilla glazed niche of social media, and of the world in general, that shows only the passive, easy route. That’s a world that ignores important issues that affect us all.  \\n That being said, if you’re a The North Face customer, chances are you enjoy the outdoors. Thus, that vanilla niche without conflict doesn’t actually exist. [Climate change is affecting every biome, every ecological niche on the planet](https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems). [This is undisputed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change) [Public lands are at risk for being sold to private owners](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/rule-easing-public-lands-transfer-concerns-hunters-44814365), preventing our access to enjoy open spaces.  \\n The North Face isn’t afraid of making this known. That the world we live in isn’t a neutral sea of vanilla and fresh powder. Of course I, too, wish it were as simple as that. That there weren’t climate change or discrimination. That women in this country didn’t have to face the possibility of losing access to affordable birth control, Pap smears, and family planning services.\\n\\n#### ![screen-shot-2017-01-24-at-20-28-43](/content/images/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-24-at-20-28-43.png)\\n\\n#### What’s Happened Since The March\\n\\nTo reiterate how The North Face wasn’t posting merely for dramatic effect, but out of real reason for concern, just yesterday, [President Trump reinstated the Gag Rule](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/trump-ban-foreign-aid-abortions.html). This is the defunding for any NGO that even *mentions *abortions as part of their services, this includes Planned Parenthood International. When in reality, these NGOs are primarily providing critically important reproductive health and family planning services.  \\n*[It won’t stop abortion, but it will make it less safe.](http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/23/14356582/trump-global-gag-rule-abortion)*Experts suggest that this will result in an increase in deaths in developing countries, which currently receive care from such NGOs, due to an expected increase in unsafe abortions and lack of access to and birth control. [Abortion rates are lower when access to affordable birth control is available.](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-us-abortion-rates-20170117-story.html)  \\n This is a prime example of how women around the world are already worse off than they were last week. The world and now our country, more so than ever, are far from vanilla.  \\n Lastly: the health of our environment. Just this morning [President Trump just revived the Keystone XL pipeline and passed construction orders on the Dakota Access pipeline](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/keystone-dakota-pipeline-trump.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news). Concerning Earth’s health, this is not good. It’s undisputed that these pipelines will negatively, and significantly, contribute to climate change.  \\n We have a long, dare I say terrifying, four years ahead of us. At the very, very least we can exude infinite compassion.\\n\\n#### Find Your Two New Favorite Phone Numbers\\n\\nIf you’re compelled to actively speak out, which I highly encourage you to do so, here are the phone numbers of every state’s Senators. The way approval for each Cabinet nominee (leaders of Executive Branch Departments) works is the Senate votes on each nominee and a simple majority is all it takes for approval. Thus, calling your state’s two Senators and urging them to consider each of Trump’s cabinet nominees very carefully would be *doing something*.  \\n Specific to the environment, I recommend you recommend your Senator to *not* vote for Trump’s EPA director nominee, [Scott Pruitt](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/us/scott-pruitt-trump-epa-pick.html), who has spent much of his time as Oklahoma’s attorney general fighting the EPA over clean air and water regulations and greenhouse gas emission mitigations.  \\n I don’t care if you’re red, blue, purple, or tie-dye, if you care about the quality of air you breath, of water you drink and whether your grandkids will get to play in ample snow, you should probably speed dial your Senators now. Leave a message if they aren’t there, or call back during office hours tomorrow.  \\n In alphabetical order by state:  \\n Jeff Sessions (R-AL) (202) 224-4124  \\n Richard Shelby (R-AL) (202) 224-5744  \\n Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) (202) 224-6665  \\n Dan Sullivan (R-AK) (202) 224-3004  \\n Jeff Flake (R-AZ) (202) 224-4521  \\n John McCain (R-AZ) (202) 224-2235  \\n John Boozman (R-AR) (202) 224-4843  \\n Tom Cotton (R-AR) (202) 224-2353  \\n Barbara Boxer (D-CA) (202) 224-3553  \\n Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) (202) 224-3841  \\n Michael Bennet (D-CO) (202) 224-5852  \\n Cory Gardner (R-CO) (202) 224-5941  \\n Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) (202) 224-2823  \\n Chris Murphy (D-CT) (202) 224-4041  \\n Tom Carper (D-DE) (202) 224-2441  \\n Chris Coons (D-DE) (202) 224-5042  \\n Bill Nelson (D-FL) (202) 224-5274  \\n Marco Rubio (R-FL) (202) 224-3041  \\n Johnny Isakson (R-GA) (202) 224-3643  \\n David Perdue (R-GA) (202) 224-3521  \\n Mazie Hirono (D-HI) (202) 224-6361  \\n Brian Schatz (D-HI) (202) 224-3934  \\n Mike Crapo (R-ID) (202) 224-6142  \\n Jim Risch (R-ID) (202) 224-2752  \\n Dick Durbin (D-IL) (202) 224-2152  \\n Mark Kirk (R-IL) (202) 224-2854  \\n Dan Coats (R-IN) (202) 224-5623  \\n Joe Donnelly (D-IN) (202) 224-4814  \\n Joni Ernst (R-IA) (202) 224-3254  \\n Chuck Grassley (R-IA) (202) 224-3744  \\n Jerry Moran (R-KS) (202) 224-6521  \\n Pat Roberts (R-KS) (202) 224-4774  \\n Mitch McConnell (R-KY) (202) 224-2541  \\n Rand Paul (R-KY) (202) 224-4343  \\n Bill Cassidy (R-LA) (202) 224-5824  \\n Dave Vitter (R-LA) (202) 224-4623  \\n Susan Collins (R-ME) (202) 224-2523  \\n Angus King (I-ME) (202) 224-5344  \\n Ben Cardin (D-MD) (202) 224-4524  \\n Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) (202) 224-4654  \\n Ed Markey (D-MA) (202) 224-2742  \\n Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) (202) 224-4543  \\n Gary Peters (D-MI) (202) 224-6221  \\n Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) (202) 224-4822  \\n Al Franken (D-MN) (202) 224-5641  \\n Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) (202) 224-3244  \\n Thad Cochran (R-MS) (202) 224-5054  \\n Roger Wicker (R-MS) (202) 224-6253  \\n Roy Blunt (R-MO) (202) 224-5721  \\n Claire McCaskill (D-MO) (202) 224-6154  \\n Steve Daines (R-MT) (202) 224-2651  \\n Jon Tester (D-MT) (202) 224-2644  \\n Deb Fischer (R-NE) (202) 224-6551  \\n Ben Sasse (R-NE) (202) 224-4224  \\n Dean Heller (R-NV) (202) 224-6244  \\n Harry Reid (D-NV) (202) 224-3542  \\n Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) (202) 224-3324  \\n Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) (202) 224-2841  \\n Cory Booker (D-NJ) (202) 224-3224  \\n Bob Menendez (D-NJ) (202) 224-4744  \\n Martin Heinrich (D-NM) (202) 224-5521  \\n Tom Udall (D-NM) (202) 224-6621  \\n Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) (202) 224-4451  \\n Chuck Schumer (D-NY) (202) 224-6542  \\n Richard Burr (R-NC) (202) 224-3154  \\n Thom Tillis (R-NC) (202) 224-6342  \\n Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) (202) 224-2043  \\n John Hoeven (R-ND) (202) 224-2551  \\n Sherrod Brown (D-OH) (202) 224-2315  \\n Rob Portman (R-OH) (202) 224-3353  \\n Jim Inhofe (R-OK) (202) 224-4721  \\n James Lankford (R-OK) (202) 224-5754  \\n Jeff Merkley (D-OR) (202) 224-3753  \\n Ron Wyden (D-OR) (202) 224-5244  \\n Bob Casey (D-PA) (202) 224-6324  \\n Pat Toomey (R-PA) (202) 224-4254  \\n Jack Reed (D-RI) (202) 224-4642  \\n Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) (202) 224-2921  \\n Lindsey Graham (R-SC) (202) 224-5972  \\n Tim Scott (R-SC) (202) 224-6121  \\n Mike Rounds (R-SD) (202) 224-5842  \\n John Thune (R-SD) (202) 224-2321  \\n Lamar Alexander (R-TN) (202) 224-4944  \\n Bob Corker (R-TN) (202) 224-3344  \\n John Cornyn (R-TX) (202) 224-2934  \\n Ted Cruz (R-TX) (202) 224-5922  \\n Orrin Hatch (R-UT) (202) 224-5251  \\n Mike Lee (R-UT) (202) 224-5444  \\n Patrick Leahy (D-VT) (202) 224-4242  \\n Bernie Sanders (I-VT) (202) 224-5141  \\n Tim Kaine (D-VA) (202) 224-4024  \\n Mark Warner (D-VA) (202) 224-2023  \\n Maria Cantwell (D-WA) (202) 224-3441  \\n Patty Murray (D-WA) (202) 224-2621  \\n Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) (202) 224-6472  \\n Joe Manchin (D-WV) (202) 224-3954  \\n Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) (202) 224-5653  \\n Ron Johnson (R-WI) (202) 224-5323  \\n John Barrasso (R-WY) (202) 224-6441  \\n Mike Enzi (R-WY) (202) 224-3424  \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}",

The way approval for each Cabinet nominee (leaders of Executive Branch Departments) works is the Senate votes on each nominee and a simple majority is all it takes for approval. Thus, calling your state’s two Senators and urging them to consider each of Trump’s cabinet nominees very carefully would be <em>doing something</em>.<br>\nSpecific to the environment, I recommend you recommend your Senator to <em>not</em> vote for Trump’s EPA director nominee, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/us/scott-pruitt-trump-epa-pick.html\">Scott Pruitt</a>, who has spent much of his time as Oklahoma’s attorney general fighting the EPA over clean air and water regulations and greenhouse gas emission mitigations.<br>\nI don’t care if you’re red, blue, purple, or tie-dye, if you care about the quality of air you breath, of water you drink and whether your grandkids will get to play in ample snow, you should probably speed dial your Senators now.

Second, what’s\nhappened since. Third, some very important phone numbers.\n\n![_dsc8860](/content/images/2017/01/dsc8860.jpg)\nPhoto: @carolinelovesphotosThe Women’s March\nFeeling full of hope, yet also full of exhaustion. I’m tired of everything that\nis unfair, wrong and depressing. My privilege is overwhelming to the point of\nguilt. I feel empowered, yet paralyzed. I feel swift and strong, yet so\ninsignificant. I sometimes wonder if there’s any point in trying to make change.\nThen I remember this awe-inspiring thing called humanity. I remember that I’m a\npart of it. Like in a bee colony, every bee matters. I’m a worker bee and\nthere’s lots of pollen to collect. Small granules that I’m capable and willing\nto pick up, to bring back to the hive. Like a hive needs individual pollen\ngranules, humanity needs individuals making small changes of improvement.\nFor me, it starts with unyielding compassion. Compassion for the people I\ninteract with everyday. Compassion for people who deserve extra love and\nunderstanding due to their genetics, their upbringing, their lack of\nopportunity, their bad luck. Going the extra pollen granule to give someone the\nbenefit of the doubt.\nLike the person who needs an extra quarter at the launder mat, who doesn’t speak\nmuch English, but hey, THIS IS AMERICA! Who cares if he doesn’t know English in\nthis moment? Give him a quarter because you are both part of this thing called\nhumanity. And the chance that he has had less privilege than you, by complete\nrandomness, is pretty darn high. Let’s all realize that a lot of our success is\ndue to our genes and our upbringing. Think about people’s misfortunes similarly.\nOften, misfortunes are actually not someone’s personal fault, but due to those\nrandom parts of each of us.\nWe could all exude more compassion for the randomness of humanity. If we all did\nour part to collect more pollen for the hive, we’d be better off. This means:\nstand up for those discriminated against on basis of religion, sexuality,\nethnicity, wealth, or myriad other reasons; give that quarter to a fellow human;\ngive that $50 to Planned Parenthood; buy less crap you don’t need; use less\nenergy that emits fossil fuels; donate your time locally to those who need your\npollen.\nThough this should’ve been my biggest goal at the onset of the New Year, it took\ntwenty days and the largest march in history to catalyze these thoughts and to\nrealize now, more than ever, the importance of compassion.\n\nForgoing the Passive Route\nI’m so grateful to be associated with a company like The North Face, who skipped\nthe easy, passive route this weekend. The North Face told its athletes that it\nsupported us if we wanted to march. I was planning on going already,\ncoincidentally (or not) with my TNF teammate, sky running shredder, Hillary\nAllen and photographer friend Caroline Treadway. The North Face didn’t stop at\njust support. They posted two photos about the March on their Instagram\n[https://www.instagram.com/thenorthface/]. The photos showcased support for\neverything the March stood for: equality for all, climate change mitigation,\nwomen’s and minorities’ rights.\n\nSure, it would’ve been extremely easy for TNF to not post anything about\nthe March. To choose a sweet ski or snowboard photo to amaze and inspire us\nduring these winter months. But no. Those photos come the day before and the day\nafter January 20th. On this seminal day, The North Face chose to stand for\nequality and for what’s right in this increasingly frightening atmosphere. The\nNorth Face chose to stand for compassion.\nMy take on the few comments that opposed these posts is simple: If someone wants\nto live in a vanilla world where climate change and discrimination against\nminorities and women doesn’t exist, then by all means, I encourage the search\nfor that vanilla glazed niche of social media, and of the world in general, that\nshows only the passive, easy route. That’s a world that ignores important issues\nthat affect us all.\nThat being said, if you’re a The North Face customer, chances are you enjoy the\noutdoors. Thus, that vanilla niche without conflict doesn’t actually exist. \nClimate change is affecting every biome, every ecological niche on the planet\n[https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems]. This is\nundisputed. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change] \n Public lands are at risk for being sold to private owners\n[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/rule-easing-public-lands-transfer-concerns-hunters-44814365]\n, preventing our access to enjoy open spaces.\nThe North Face isn’t afraid of making this known. That the world we live in\nisn’t a neutral sea of vanilla and fresh powder. Of course I, too, wish it were\nas simple as that. That there weren’t climate change or discrimination. That\nwomen in this country didn’t have to face the possibility of losing access to\naffordable birth control, Pap smears, and family planning services.\n\n\nWhat’s Happened Since The March\nTo reiterate how The North Face wasn’t posting merely for dramatic effect, but\nout of real reason for concern, just yesterday, President Trump reinstated the\nGag Rule\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/world/trump-ban-foreign-aid-abortions.html].\nThis is the defunding for any NGO that even *mentions *abortions as part of\ntheir services, this includes Planned Parenthood International. When in reality,\nthese NGOs are primarily providing critically important reproductive health and\nfamily planning services.\n*It won’t stop abortion, but it will make it less safe.\n[http://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/23/14356582/trump-global-gag-rule-abortion]\n*Experts suggest that this will result in an increase in deaths in developing\ncountries, which currently receive care from such NGOs, due to an expected\nincrease in unsafe abortions and lack of access to and birth control.Abortion\nrates are lower when access to affordable birth control is available.\n[http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-us-abortion-rates-20170117-story.html]\nThis is a prime example of how women around the world are already worse off than\nthey were last week. The world and now our country, more so than ever, are far\nfrom vanilla.\nLastly: the health of our environment. Just this morning President Trump just\nrevived the Keystone XL pipeline and passed construction orders on the Dakota\nAccess pipeline\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/keystone-dakota-pipeline-trump.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news]\n. Concerning Earth’s health, this is not good. It’s undisputed that these\npipelines will negatively, and significantly, contribute to climate change.\nWe have a long, dare I say terrifying, four years ahead of us. At the very, very\nleast we can exude infinite compassion.\n\nFind Your Two New Favorite Phone Numbers\nIf you’re compelled to actively speak out, which I highly encourage you to do\nso, here are the phone numbers of every state’s Senators.

You shouldn’t inflict your beliefs into every poor soul you meet, especially when you don’t have a real conversation contextualizing the advice.” In summary, the best advice I’ve ever received is: chill the F out and have fun.

I promise you this: You will outlive the\nbastards.”\n\n—Edward Abbey (American author and essayist, known for his opinions on\nenvironmental advocacy and criticism of public land policies)",

It’s from deforestation of primary\nrainforests–think about those orangutang orphanages in Borneo–in order to clear\nland for for agricultural crops and plantations, especially palm oil; it’s from\noverfishing, pollution, and wildlife and exotic species trades, to name a few.\nBut above all, human greenhouse gas emissions are still the most frightening and\nconsequential impact to Earth.\nIn a monumental stance for the U.S., President Obama formally entered America\ninto theParis Climate Agreement\n[http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php] last fall. This means that\nthe U.S. is buying into the concept of halting man-made climate change by\ncommitting to reduce our emissions in the next few decades in order to prevent a\nglobal temperature rise above 2 degrees C.\nOne of Trump’s campaign promises was to pull out of the Paris Agreement.\nHowever, the tables are turning, askey advisors to Trump suggest this is a bad\ndecision\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/us/politics/trump-advisers-paris-climate-accord.html?_r=0]\n.  There are no pragmatic reasons to pull out of the agreement. We must stay in\nit.\nThere are myriad examples of why this is the case. A poignant and rather\nparadoxical one is the recent news about the Kentucky Coal Mining Museum. In\nearly April, it decided to switch to solar powerin order to save money. You\nheard that. A coal mining museum realized that the future is in renewable energy\nand it’s already cheaper to switch its energy source to solar because it will “\nsave at least eight to ten thousand dollars, off the energy costs on this\nbuilding alone\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/opinion/coal-museum-sees-the-future-trump-doesnt.html?_r=0]\n.”\nOn a similar note, jobs in the U.S. solar energy industry have increased so much\nin the past decade, they now outnumber the number of employees at Apple,\nGoogle,\nand Facebook, combined\n[https://thinkprogress.org/soaring-demand-for-global-solar-53f11bcaa89e],\naccording to the The Solar Foundation [http://www.thesolarfoundation.org/]*.\n*The stats are clear, but we have to continue to fight fight fight in order to\nmake Trump accept these facts.\nSo even though Trump has big plans to dismantle all of the climate progress our\ncountry has made, there’s a strong reason to believe we, the believers in facts\nand the believers in an Earth with biodiversity and healthy ecosystems, have the\nupper hand. Choose hybrids and electric vehicles for your next car. Or just\ndon’t support buying a new standard gasoline-fueled car. Watch how your state\nrepresentatives, governors, and city-council members vote on local emission\nreduction plans. Then vote for them accordingly. Even though the climate change\nfight is universal, it can be won locally, without the asinine executive\ndecisions of our current President.\n\n![A03I1389-Edit-Edit](/content/images/2017/04/a03i1389-edit-edit.jpg)\nWe may be small, but we are mighty!

Here’s how I handled it and what I learned through the process. I will follow this up with a more recent account of what I’ve learned in the past year after transitioning to ultras and how my attitude towards injury has changed, and how it hasn’t.  \\n HOW MYSTERIOUS KNEE PAIN CHANGED MY LIFE  \\n I was in my sophomore cross country season at Princeton, fitter than I’d ever been, gunning to be a scorer, top 5, for our team by the end of the season. Then during one Sunday long run , I was chatting away with my teammates, including steeplechase phenom Ashley Higginson, who I remember lost a necklace pendant on the run (we all stopped and scoured the tow path to look for it), when my left knee audibly clicked and I felt a sharp, persistent pain that wouldn’t go away. As injuries often go, we were seven miles away from Princeton’s campus. I did high knees and butt kicks all of the way back to deal with the stabbing pain. The clicking stopped, but the pain wouldn’t stop. Little did I know that this would be a ten-month ordeal until I felt relief and could run again.  \\n At first, my trainer diagnosed it as Runner’s Knee: the common, and painful, ailment from overuse and weak thigh muscles, especially a weak VMO (vastus medialis oblique). I definitely had a weaker VMO on my left side, but after an entire winter of strengthening exercises and too many hours spent in Princeton’s archaic rec center pool, I had no improvement. If anything, the pain was worse. I couldn’t walk down stairs without grimacing. The Runner’s Knee/patellafemoral syndrome tape job didn’t help either. I was so hopeful it would help that I tried a ten-minute run the day my trainer applied tape. We’ve all been there. “Maybe this tiny piece of tape will miraculously heal me and I’ll be running 60 miles next week, racing in three weeks!” But of course, that’s not how it works. This is called the ‘denial of injury phase.’ It can last weeks to years. Mine lasted about three months until I had enough and moved onto phase two.  \\n After indoor track came and went, I stopped showing up to the beginning of practice—most injured members of the team would do this to keep some semblance of routine and normalcy to a life without running. But I was already spending so much time in the training room, doing stupid little squats, getting e-stim (electronic stimulation) on my VMO, and swimming, that I couldn’t bear to spend another moment watching my teammates getting ready to run. How simple the life of a non-injured runner seemed: run for an hour, talk with friends, have fun, sweat, shower, and be done. I missed the ease, efficiency, and stress-release of being a healthy runner unlike anything I’d missed before in my life.  \\n I masked my depression by hanging out with new, non-runner friends who valued substances over sleep. I wallowed in my inability to run and subsequently found myself partying harder than ever. I drank more liquid calories of alcohol than I ate in whole foods. I started dating a senior, a wonderful guy, but he was as far removed from the running scene as I was immersed in it, at least at my core. Almost every night was marked with outrageous parties, mainly with second-semester seniors who were done with their theses. Never mind I was a sophomore. Somehow, I was able to get through classes like a breeze. I attribute it to not being tired from training, and from a lot of caffeine. I stopped swimming altogether. I saw no point in keeping my fitness at bay, especially because I could stay thin by not eating. I created a life that seemed to be based around fun, efficiency, and anti-running. I went to the important outdoor track meets, like HEPS, the Ivy League Meet, which gave me the credibility of still supporting my team because it meant missing a giant day party at Princeton, called Lawn Parities. But deep down, I was beginning to despise running. It ruined my sense of normal. Not running was changing me, for the worse.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_726\\\" style=\\\"width: 720px\\\">![10155481_10152348079250953_7564026370032612495_n](/content/images/2017/04/10155481_10152348079250953_7564026370032612495_n.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Trying to forget about my inability to run. </figcaption></figure>  \\n Not many of my running teammates, my true best friends, knew what I was up to. They cared about me, but also knew that I needed space from running in order to get through this mysterious knee injury. In my reluctance to acknowledge that running was even a thing, never mind an activity that I loved more than anything else—this is called the ‘denial of passion phase’—I applied for a summer internship in Bermuda. A non-runner friend encouraged me. “Who cares if you can’t train there? You need to look out for your future life, which isn’t all about running.” Had I been healthy, I would’ve never applied to an internship in Bermuda to study coral. I knew the summer would be spent mainly underwater, and Bermuda is a tiny island, so training would be very difficult. But as the spring sped by, in a blur of sleepless nights, I questioned if I’d ever run again. I got the internship, and as life would have it, this catapulted my passion for coral reefs and allowed me to spend the following summer in Palau, eventually publishing a journal paper on reef ecology in Palau.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_721\\\" style=\\\"width: 720px\\\">![404103_10152025204965192_1032189855_n](/content/images/2017/04/404103_10152025204965192_1032189855_n.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Summer internship in Bermuda, studying the effects of ocean acidification on coral larvae.</figcaption></figure>  \\n But, as far as my injury was concerned, I was still at ground zero. I saw five different doctors by the time the school year ended in June, which elucidated nothing.

I avoided stairs at all costs.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_722\\\" style=\\\"width: 604px\\\">![562805_10151960755000375_914274151_n](/content/images/2017/04/562805_10151960755000375_914274151_n.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Even getting in and out of the boat to go SCUBA diving wasn’t great for my knee. BUT I got to SCUBA dive! </figcaption></figure>  \\n In Bermuda, I was distracted by the magnificent, and ever-changing marine world. I became scientific-SCUBA certified, and performed the diving and lab work for an eventually published project on ocean acidification on baby corals. The natural world had never felt so infinitely fascinating, and troubled. It was here where I saw the effects of climate change on our oceans firsthand. It was also in Bermuda where I continued to party hard. Running was so far past my potential, even though I was still working to fix my injury. I solicited the help of a nutritionist who thought maybe I was allergic to nightshade vegetables, somehow related being a celiac. She said eating them could cause intense inflammation. But after a month of not eating nightshade vegetables and of drinking a very expensive box full of anti-inflammation powder drinks air-mailed by my unflappable, loving and supportive parents, my knee was the same. I gained weight, welcomingly, as I stopped looking in a mirror. I began to swim again in a jaw-dropping beautiful channel in front of the scientific research campus I lived at. I tried running a few times during the anti-nightshade vegetable phase, only to be disappointed when the pain would worsen within an hour after a ten-minute run.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_725\\\" style=\\\"width: 2048px\\\">![1501351_10151808012685592_1833415689_o](/content/images/2017/04/1501351_10151808012685592_1833415689_o.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Friends and swimming can make not running more tolerable. </figcaption></figure>  \\n Feeling newly alive with coral reef stoke, by the end of the summer, my party-hard mentality simmered down. I was swimming and contemplating a life of scientific research, exploration and travel, sans running. Bermuda gave me the perspective I needed. But it was far from a done deal.  \\n Fall came and I was still not running. My teammates, fitter than ever, as all cross country seasons commence, were still supportive, but more aloof towards me. That’s what happens when a teammate is injured for multiple consecutive seasons: she or he is forgotten about. For some, that can be debilitating and alienating to an extreme. I used it to my advantage, hanging out with non-runners once again. Skipping practices and meetings to go to a music festival during pre-season. But deep down, my passion for running was back, stronger than ever. I needed a solution. At last, I got an MRI. I should’ve gotten an MRI the previous winter, but the diagnosis of Runner’s Knee didn’t justify an MRI. My MRI result: I was missing a 5mm chunk of cartilage underneath my kneecap, which would explain the sharp pain: nerve pain from bone on bone rubbing. The term for this is chondromalacia, which is also often called Runner’s Knee. Knee injuries are so common and yet complex that many diagnoses get muddled together. It takes an MRI to plan an effective course of treatment.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_739\\\" style=\\\"width: 1530px\\\">![202109_4568810787992_578904111_o](/content/images/2017/04/202109_4568810787992_578904111_o.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Starting my junior year with a knee brace.</figcaption></figure>  \\n Against the advice of all of the Princeton sports doctors, I decided to get a PRP injection (platelet rich plasma) in my kneecap. I’d read it helped runners with symptoms similar to my own. My other options were: continue to wait or get my knee scoped. Against surgery at all costs, PRP was my only choice. My PRP experience was sketchy. I went through an acupuncturist, who somehow was able to take my insurance by categorizing the shot as yet another cortisone injection. PRP is usually an out-of-pocket expense, since it’s not widely used yet, that costs anywhere from $500 – over $1,000. My injection took place in a random strip mall office in suburban Trenton. How it works is: a nurse or doctor draws blood from your arm, puts your blood in a centrifuge to spin it down, which separates the platelet rich plasma from the other components. Platelets and the liquid plasma of the blood contain lots of factors that are essential for cell recruitment, multiplication and specialization required for healing. When injected to an injured area of bone or soft tissue, it spurs a healing event with few side effects because it is your own blood. My injection worked LIKE A CHARM. I was numb in my left leg for a day, but the local numbing eventually wore off. After wearing a full leg brace for three days, on day four, I tried to run. No pain. It is the closest feeling I’ve ever had to magic. Within a month, I was back to 50-mile weeks of running. I competed in my junior indoor track season and outdoor track seasons. I had my best cross country season my senior fall, after spending a summer doing coral research in the island nation of Palau, which is even smaller than Bermuda. I made training work and fearlessly didn’t let running dictate my academic and travel life. To this day, though, those ten months have left a mark. I realize that I’m happiest while not partying, and that almost any ailment, from a broken heart to a bum knee can be treated by the wondrous natural world we live in. I also learned to never throw in the towel, even if you’ve let it sit by itself for a period of time.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_742\\\" style=\\\"width: 790px\\\">![297045_10151590192545219_398939144_n](/content/images/2017/04/297045_10151590192545219_398939144_n.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Racing healthy: steeplechase my junior track season. </figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}",

My injection worked LIKE A CHARM. I was numb in my left leg for a day, but the local numbing eventually wore off. After wearing a full leg brace for three days, on day four, I tried to run. No pain. It is the closest feeling I’ve ever had to magic. Within a month, I was back to 50-mile weeks of running. I competed in my junior indoor track season and outdoor track seasons. I had my best cross country season my senior fall, after spending a summer doing coral research in the island nation of Palau, which is even smaller than Bermuda. I made training work and fearlessly didn’t let running dictate my academic and travel life. To this day, though, those ten months have left a mark. I realize that I’m happiest while not partying, and that almost any ailment, from a broken heart to a bum knee can be treated by the wondrous natural world we live in. I also learned to never throw in the towel, even if you’ve let it sit by itself for a period of time.  \n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_742\" style=\"width: 790px\">![297045_10151590192545219_398939144_n](/content/images/2017/04/297045_10151590192545219_398939144_n.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Racing healthy: steeplechase my junior track season. </figcaption></figure>\n</div>",

            "plaintext": "Thanks to friend, runner, and now injury-blogger Jenny DeSouchet\n[http://holdfasthealth.com/2017/04/21/knee-pain-scuba-diving-and-strip-mall-healing-how-clare-gallaghers-mysterious-college-injury-changed-her-life/]\n, I wrote this piece on a long injury I had while running at Princeton. Here’s\nhow I handled it and what I learned through the process. I will follow this up\nwith a more recent account of what I’ve learned in the past year after\ntransitioning to ultras and how my attitude towards injury has changed, and how\nit hasn’t.\nHOW MYSTERIOUS KNEE PAIN CHANGED MY LIFE\nI was in my sophomore cross country season at Princeton, fitter than I’d ever\nbeen, gunning to be a scorer, top 5, for our team by the end of the season. Then\nduring one Sunday long run , I was chatting away with my teammates, including\nsteeplechase phenom Ashley Higginson, who I remember lost a necklace pendant on\nthe run (we all stopped and scoured the tow path to look for it), when my left\nknee audibly clicked and I felt a sharp, persistent pain that wouldn’t go away.\nAs injuries often go, we were seven miles away from Princeton’s campus. I did\nhigh knees and butt kicks all of the way back to deal with the stabbing pain.\nThe clicking stopped, but the pain wouldn’t stop. Little did I know that this\nwould be a ten-month ordeal until I felt relief and could run again.\nAt first, my trainer diagnosed it as Runner’s Knee: the common, and painful,\nailment from overuse and weak thigh muscles, especially a weak VMO (vastus\nmedialis oblique). I definitely had a weaker VMO on my left side, but after an\nentire winter of strengthening exercises and too many hours spent in Princeton’s\narchaic rec center pool, I had no improvement. If anything, the pain was worse.\nI couldn’t walk down stairs without grimacing. The Runner’s Knee/patellafemoral\nsyndrome tape job didn’t help either. I was so hopeful it would help that I\ntried a ten-minute run the day my trainer applied tape. We’ve all been there.\n“Maybe this tiny piece of tape will miraculously heal me and I’ll be running 60\nmiles next week, racing in three weeks!” But of course, that’s not how it works.\nThis is called the ‘denial of injury phase.’ It can last weeks to years. Mine\nlasted about three months until I had enough and moved onto phase two.\nAfter indoor track came and went, I stopped showing up to the beginning of\npractice—most injured members of the team would do this to keep some semblance\nof routine and normalcy to a life without running. But I was already spending so\nmuch time in the training room, doing stupid little squats, getting e-stim\n(electronic stimulation) on my VMO, and swimming, that I couldn’t bear to spend\nanother moment watching my teammates getting ready to run. How simple the life\nof a non-injured runner seemed: run for an hour, talk with friends, have fun,\nsweat, shower, and be done. I missed the ease, efficiency, and stress-release of\nbeing a healthy runner unlike anything I’d missed before in my life.\nI masked my depression by hanging out with new, non-runner friends who valued\nsubstances over sleep. I wallowed in my inability to run and subsequently found\nmyself partying harder than ever. I drank more liquid calories of alcohol than I\nate in whole foods. I started dating a senior, a wonderful guy, but he was as\nfar removed from the running scene as I was immersed in it, at least at my core.\nAlmost every night was marked with outrageous parties, mainly with\nsecond-semester seniors who were done with their theses. Never mind I was a\nsophomore. Somehow, I was able to get through classes like a breeze. I attribute\nit to not being tired from training, and from a lot of caffeine. I stopped\nswimming altogether. I saw no point in keeping my fitness at bay, especially\nbecause I could stay thin by not eating. I created a life that seemed to be\nbased around fun, efficiency, and anti-running. I went to the important outdoor\ntrack meets, like HEPS, the Ivy League Meet, which gave me the credibility of\nstill supporting my team because it meant missing a giant day party at\nPrinceton, called Lawn Parities. But deep down, I was beginning to despise\nrunning. It ruined my sense of normal. Not running was changing me, for the\nworse.\n\n![10155481_10152348079250953_7564026370032612495_n](/content/images/2017/04/10155481_10152348079250953_7564026370032612495_n.jpg)\nTrying to forget about my inability to run.  \nNot many of my running teammates, my true best friends, knew what I was up to.\nThey cared about me, but also knew that I needed space from running in order to\nget through this mysterious knee injury. In my reluctance to acknowledge that\nrunning was even a thing, never mind an activity that I loved more than anything\nelse—this is called the ‘denial of passion phase’—I applied for a summer\ninternship in Bermuda. A non-runner friend encouraged me. “Who cares if you\ncan’t train there? You need to look out for your future life, which isn’t all\nabout running.” Had I been healthy, I would’ve never applied to an internship in\nBermuda to study coral. I knew the summer would be spent mainly underwater, and\nBermuda is a tiny island, so training would be very difficult. But as the spring\nsped by, in a blur of sleepless nights, I questioned if I’d ever run again. I\ngot the internship, and as life would have it, this catapulted my passion for\ncoral reefs and allowed me to spend the following summer in Palau, eventually\npublishing a journal paper on reef ecology in Palau.\n![404103_10152025204965192_1032189855_n](/content/images/2017/04/404103_10152025204965192_1032189855_n.jpg)\nSummer internship in Bermuda, studying the effects of ocean acidification on\ncoral larvae.  \nBut, as far as my injury was concerned, I was still at ground zero. I saw five\ndifferent doctors by the time the school year ended in June, which elucidated\nnothing. Two cortisone shots later, the second one administered right before\nleaving for Bermuda, and my knee pain was worse than ever. I avoided stairs at\nall costs.\n![562805_10151960755000375_914274151_n](/content/images/2017/04/562805_10151960755000375_914274151_n.jpg)\nEven getting in and out of the boat to go SCUBA diving wasn’t great for my knee.\nBUT I got to SCUBA dive!  \nIn Bermuda, I was distracted by the magnificent, and ever-changing marine world.\nI became scientific-SCUBA certified, and performed the diving and lab work for\nan eventually published project on ocean acidification on baby corals. The\nnatural world had never felt so infinitely fascinating, and troubled. It was\nhere where I saw the effects of climate change on our oceans firsthand. It was\nalso in Bermuda where I continued to party hard. Running was so far past my\npotential, even though I was still working to fix my injury. I solicited the\nhelp of a nutritionist who thought maybe I was allergic to nightshade\nvegetables, somehow related being a celiac. She said eating them could cause\nintense inflammation. But after a month of not eating nightshade vegetables and\nof drinking a very expensive box full of anti-inflammation powder drinks\nair-mailed by my unflappable, loving and supportive parents, my knee was the\nsame. I gained weight, welcomingly, as I stopped looking in a mirror. I began to\nswim again in a jaw-dropping beautiful channel in front of the scientific\nresearch campus I lived at. I tried running a few times during the\nanti-nightshade vegetable phase, only to be disappointed when the pain would\nworsen within an hour after a ten-minute run.\n![1501351_10151808012685592_1833415689_o](/content/images/2017/04/1501351_10151808012685592_1833415689_o.jpg)\nFriends and swimming can make not running more tolerable.  \nFeeling newly alive with coral reef stoke, by the end of the summer, my\nparty-hard mentality simmered down. I was swimming and contemplating a life of\nscientific research, exploration and travel, sans running. Bermuda gave me the\nperspective I needed. But it was far from a done deal. \nFall came and I was still not running. My teammates, fitter than ever, as all\ncross country seasons commence, were still supportive, but more aloof towards\nme. That’s what happens when a teammate is injured for multiple consecutive\nseasons: she or he is forgotten about. For some, that can be debilitating and\nalienating to an extreme. I used it to my advantage, hanging out with\nnon-runners once again. Skipping practices and meetings to go to a music\nfestival during pre-season. But deep down, my passion for running was back,\nstronger than ever. I needed a solution. At last, I got an MRI. I should’ve\ngotten an MRI the previous winter, but the diagnosis of Runner’s Knee didn’t\njustify an MRI. My MRI result: I was missing a 5mm chunk of cartilage underneath\nmy kneecap, which would explain the sharp pain: nerve pain from bone on bone\nrubbing. The term for this is chondromalacia, which is also often called\nRunner’s Knee. Knee injuries are so common and yet complex that many diagnoses\nget muddled together. It takes an MRI to plan an effective course of treatment.\n![202109_4568810787992_578904111_o](/content/images/2017/04/202109_4568810787992_578904111_o.jpg)\nStarting my junior year with a knee brace.  \nAgainst the advice of all of the Princeton sports doctors, I decided to get a\nPRP injection (platelet rich plasma) in my kneecap. I’d read it helped runners\nwith symptoms similar to my own. My other options were: continue to wait or get\nmy knee scoped. Against surgery at all costs, PRP was my only choice. My PRP\nexperience was sketchy. I went through an acupuncturist, who somehow was able to\ntake my insurance by categorizing the shot as yet another cortisone injection.\nPRP is usually an out-of-pocket expense, since it’s not widely used yet, that\ncosts anywhere from $500 – over $1,000. My injection took place in a random\nstrip mall office in suburban Trenton. How it works is: a nurse or doctor draws\nblood from your arm, puts your blood in a centrifuge to spin it down, which\nseparates the platelet rich plasma from the other components. Platelets and the\nliquid plasma of the blood contain lots of factors that are essential for cell\nrecruitment, multiplication and specialization required for healing. When\ninjected to an injured area of bone or soft tissue, it spurs a healing event\nwith few side effects because it is your own blood. My injection worked LIKE A\nCHARM. I was numb in my left leg for a day, but the local numbing eventually\nwore off. After wearing a full leg brace for three days, on day four, I tried to\nrun. No pain. It is the closest feeling I’ve ever had to magic. Within a month,\nI was back to 50-mile weeks of running. I competed in my junior indoor track\nseason and outdoor track seasons. I had my best cross country season my senior\nfall, after spending a summer doing coral research in the island nation of\nPalau, which is even smaller than Bermuda. I made training work and fearlessly\ndidn’t let running dictate my academic and travel life. To this day, though,\nthose ten months have left a mark. I realize that I’m happiest while not\npartying, and that almost any ailment, from a broken heart to a bum knee can be\ntreated by the wondrous natural world we live in. I also learned to never throw\nin the towel, even if you’ve let it sit by itself for a period of time.\n![297045_10151590192545219_398939144_n](/content/images/2017/04/297045_10151590192545219_398939144_n.jpg)\nRacing healthy: steeplechase my junior track season.",

This works out if we want Day 0 to be the day of the race. Sure, you could say I did this on purpose.  \\n At a Running Mindful Meditation retreat at the [Shambhala Mountain Center](https://www.shambhalamountain.org/) in rural northern central Colorado—at 8,000 feet, mind you—this past weekend, I participated in group meditation and motivation discussions. I took away a collection of invaluable tidbits and reminders. I’ll share two today.\\n\\n### Light\\n\\nThe retreat drew classic Type-A overachievers, people who love to trail run and wanted to learn more about meditation and yoga, people recovering from cancer, an Iraq veteran, the list goes on. The stories shared were vulnerable, intense, eye-opening and beautiful.

Whatever you want to explore and find answers to, ask that question.”  \\n I started the run unsure of what motivation question I wanted to answer. Usually, I default to “What is my motivation for running?” But today my meditative, open mindset was flowing, so I left the question open ended, “What is my motivation?”  \\n Within minutes of the 10-minute contemplative run, I knew my answer:  \\n “To spread light.”  \\n This answer has multifaceted meaning, as today was the first day my meditation practice has taken a spontaneous leap forward.  \\n Usually when I meditate deeply, sitting, not running, my mind goes to a very blank black, blank space. Sort of like an infinite darkness in outer space. Today though, I saw bright white, a light, for the first time ever while deeply meditating. I immediately thought of the word *compassion*.  \\n Thus, when only an hour later during the “what is my motivation?” run, I received the answer “to spread light,” something—I’m not sure quite what, albeit vague, mystic, and personal—clicked.

It pushes all of us to be our best selves. It’s a self-driving quest for greatness, independent of how you stack up to a fellow racer other than how each of you push THYSELF. Yes, there are winners and losers overall, but the competition, sans comparison, is within yourself and the venue of a race.  \\n Comparison, on the other hand, can be a self-destructive jackhammer. Comparing yourself to your fellow competitors:  \\n 1) takes the fun out of the whole race or competition because it often ignites unnecessary anxiety, jealously, feelings of inadequacy, self-hatred.  \\n 2) gives unwarranted value to attributes unrelated to the competition, i.e. appearance, body-rippedness, clothing, net-worth, past race accolades.  \\n 3) often ignores human attributes that are invaluable: kindness, camaraderie, and sportsmanship.  \\n I love to compete more than most things. Yet, in the past, I’ve struggled with comparing myself to my competitors more than out right competing. What if my quads looked more like hers? How come she has those shoes? How many miles did she run this week?  \\n These types of thoughts are so pointless! They take the focus off why I’m competing in the first place: to push myself to its limit. Nothing about my competitors matters other than we are out there together, pushing, driving, shredding, laughing, crying, and sweating our balls off to be our best. End of story.

I was celebrating my older brother Eric’s 28<sup>th</sup> Birthday! On Flag Day, June 14<sup>th</sup>, nonetheless. This is symbolic because Ewic, affectionately, is serving all of us as a Captain in the Army. Ewic has taken a unique, hard-fought path to where he is today in the military. And actually, he’s studying away in Ft. Bragg North Carolina, so we didn’t celebrate in person. Regardless, he is whom I’ll be thinking of *a lot* of States. Here’s why.  \\n I won’t go into detail of his military career, as I don’t even fully understand everything. So many acronyms. But there are some parts we can all understand.  \\n As a freshman at West Point, Eric got through BEAST, the introductory summer camp that’s full of obstacle courses way less fun than Tough Mudders. This alone is an impressive feat. The attrition rates are high. It’s a big deal to sit in a classroom as a freshman at West Point because it means you got through BEAST. And Eric just happened to do it with a torn ACL.  \\n He didn’t say anything going into BEAST because he knew he’d get kicked out if West Point knew an incoming freshman, or plebe as first-year’s are called, had a torn ACL. He would fail the initial physical test if he revealed his knee pain and got an MRI. He couldn’t risk that. So he mustered through the 7-week physical training camp that ‘turns civilians into cadets.’ And afterwards found out he had a torn ACL—likely from a lacrosse game injury from senior year in high school—and got it repaired during school once he passed that initial course.  \\n Fast forward five years, past a deployment in Afghanistan where Eric was only 25 years-old, in charge of a lot of men, and suffering two tragic losses of Justin and Aaron.  \\n Fast forward more years to [RANGER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvxqxylAyE0) School. RANGER makes BEAST look puny. This is a three-month long course with some of the hardest physical and orienteering challenges people in the army have to go through. Eric graduated from a winter course—winter RANGER is touted for its difficulty due to the many nights spent sleeping outside in Georgia in the cold.  \\n And guess what? He did it with *another* torn ACL.  \\n Fast forward to Ft. Carson (Colorado Springs, CO) where Eric was a Lieutenant, in charge of a lot of men still—they called him “Army Mom”—and then he headed back East to North Carolina to start the [Q Course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Special_Forces_selection_and_training). This is the school to become a [Green Beret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces_(United_States_Army)). That’s where he is now. This school towers over BEAST and RANGER combined.  \\n The amazing thing about the training to become a Green Beret is how multidisciplinary it is. Green Berets are the humanitarian special forces. They train in unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, direct action, and counter-terrorism. But, what makes them unique amongst other special forces groups is they have to learn a local language and culture and train with foreign troops. They often are truly imbedded, all in order to stop the bad guys.  \\n Seeing what Eric has sacrificed to get to Q-School is insane. He says that what I do (running ultras) is crazy and way harder than what he does. Good one, Eric!  \\n The day-to-day focus you need to grind through these army schools, let alone a deployment, is awe-inspiring. And that he’s doing it for our country. It’s because of people like Eric and other military members that we get to run Western States so freely, without a worry worse than if our ice will melt or not.  \\n But, through all of the military ladders and physical feats he’s gone through, Eric has stayed true to his roots. He drives a Prius and tells people in the military to recycle. He gave his young charges at Ft. Carson a book locker, after he noticed so many enlisted 18- to 22 year-olds play games on their phones all the time. He studies his job. He reads books on the cultures he’s going to stay with, outside of his schoolwork. When he’s home in Colorado, he wears Avalanche and Broncos fleece pajama pants. And never really talks about what he does; he’s humble to a fault. Did I mention he recycles *in the military*?  \\n My other older brother Scott and I joke: “Eric is the best person. Ever. The nicest, kindest, strongest, most generous.” Except it’s not a joke. Ask any of his friends what Eric has done for them. He will bend over backwards to help a buddy in need out. He’ll fly anywhere on a dime, when he has time off, because he values being with friends and family practically more than anything. He spent four days in Palau with me when I was there for a summer. Now, Palau is in the Pacific Ocean, basically as remote as it gets. But Eric wanted to see me and he had time off.  \\n Heck, Eric sent my Mom and Dad flowers on *his birthday*, to thank them for their birthday gift *to him*!  \\n Anyways, Eric, Happy Birthday. Thank you for being the best person we know. I’ll run thinking I’m you at Western States. What would Eric do? 🙂 ![Eric_army](/content/images/2017/06/eric_army.jpg)  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_909\\\" style=\\\"width: 720px\\\">![206668_10150160310637012_8371567_n](/content/images/2017/06/206668_10150160310637012_8371567_n.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">A happy time at West Point Sandhurst competition. </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_910\\\" style=\\\"width: 960px\\\">![1012008_10153721537015192_1880573165_n](/content/images/2017/06/1012008_10153721537015192_1880573165_n.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Colorado standard. </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_911\\\" style=\\\"width: 2048px\\\">![1073763_10153045000195192_2112361238_o](/content/images/2017/06/1073763_10153045000195192_2112361238_o.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">In Palau, where Eric kindly agreed to snorkel on a very exposed open reef wall with more than a few sharks.

This is the school to become a Green Beret\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Forces_(United_States_Army)]. That’s\nwhere he is now. This school towers over BEAST and RANGER combined.\nThe amazing thing about the training to become a Green Beret is how\nmultidisciplinary it is. Green Berets are the humanitarian special forces. They\ntrain in unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, special\nreconnaissance, direct action, and counter-terrorism. But, what makes them\nunique amongst other special forces groups is they have to learn a local\nlanguage and culture and train with foreign troops. They often are truly\nimbedded, all in order to stop the bad guys.\nSeeing what Eric has sacrificed to get to Q-School is insane. He says that what\nI do (running ultras) is crazy and way harder than what he does. Good one, Eric!\nThe day-to-day focus you need to grind through these army schools, let alone a\ndeployment, is awe-inspiring. And that he’s doing it for our country. It’s\nbecause of people like Eric and other military members that we get to run\nWestern States so freely, without a worry worse than if our ice will melt or\nnot.\nBut, through all of the military ladders and physical feats he’s gone through,\nEric has stayed true to his roots. He drives a Prius and tells people in the\nmilitary to recycle. He gave his young charges at Ft. Carson a book locker,\nafter he noticed so many enlisted 18- to 22 year-olds play games on their phones\nall the time. He studies his job. He reads books on the cultures he’s going to\nstay with, outside of his schoolwork. When he’s home in Colorado, he wears\nAvalanche and Broncos fleece pajama pants. And never really talks about what he\ndoes; he’s humble to a fault. Did I mention he recycles in the military?\nMy other older brother Scott and I joke: “Eric is the best person. Ever. The\nnicest, kindest, strongest, most generous.” Except it’s not a joke. Ask any of\nhis friends what Eric has done for them. He will bend over backwards to help a\nbuddy in need out. He’ll fly anywhere on a dime, when he has time off, because\nhe values being with friends and family practically more than anything. He spent\nfour days in Palau with me when I was there for a summer. Now, Palau is in the\nPacific Ocean, basically as remote as it gets. But Eric wanted to see me and he\nhad time off.\nHeck, Eric sent my Mom and Dad flowers on his birthday, to thank them for their\nbirthday gift to him!\nAnyways, Eric, Happy Birthday. Thank you for being the best person we know. I’ll\nrun thinking I’m you at Western States. What would Eric do? 🙂\n\n![206668_10150160310637012_8371567_n](/content/images/2017/06/206668_10150160310637012_8371567_n.jpg)\nA happy time at West Point Sandhurst competition.\n![1012008_10153721537015192_1880573165_n](/content/images/2017/06/1012008_10153721537015192_1880573165_n.jpg)\nColorado standard.\n![1073763_10153045000195192_2112361238_o](/content/images/2017/06/1073763_10153045000195192_2112361238_o.jpg)\nIn Palau, where Eric kindly agreed to snorkel on a very exposed open reef wall\nwith more than a few sharks.

Nothing beats some home-grown normalcy.\n    Benefits of a taper mean you have to slow down and not be on top of a\n    mountain all the time, going from workout to computer to workout, or not be\n    driving back from some godforsaken state park at 3am on a Monday morning.\n    Of course, there’s a time and a place for everything. 🙂\n    But yesterday, I was grateful to have time with my parents and my other\n    older brother, Scott, who is interning at a Public Defender’s office in\n    Colorado this summer. Most likely, Scottie will end up a Public Defender if\n    he stays on this track. Thinking about his crazy intense trial-by-fire work,\n    about my Dad’s worms, about the state of the world’s bees, about how ungodly\n    nice my Mom is, making me ice bandanas for this weekend, I can’t help but\n    tear up. I’m so grateful. Tapering makes me emotional.\n    I’m going to go look at the course map now.",

A tester to see if my leg/hamstring/back of knee is healing.  \\n I had felt fine walking around all week almost to the point that I wondered if it was, in fact, my hamstring that blew up. During the race, I was convinced it was my upper calf, because pain had started there around mile 70 and I began compensating for bad blisters around 35. By 80, I was sporadically grabbing the back of my knee and upper calf, and when 89 hit, I was grabbing the back of my knee for all of those final agonizing miles.  \\n But the morning after my race ended, a medical helper had told me that it was likely my lower hamstring attachment that was strained. Made sense. In my mind, I went with it, have treated my hamstring aggressively, and have hoped that when I tried to do more than walk to and from the kitchen, I’d be okay.  \\n Not the case. Upon the first step I took running downhill this past weekend, one week post-States, I felt that exact searing sensation that ended my race. I’m equally as puzzled as I was during the race. I cannot straighten my leg without the stabbing.  \\n “No, it’s not your hamstring,” my acupuncturist and physical therapist friends said. “It’s probably your popliteus.”  \\n “My what?”  \\n “A tiny muscle buried three muscles deep in the back of your knee.”  \\n “Hmm. Okay.”  \\n Thus begins the process of getting an accurate diagnosis and treating the problem.  \\n Even though I’m only 25, I feel like I’ve run a thorough gamut with injuries. As I wrote on this blog earlier this year, as only a sophomore in college, I was sidelined for over 10 months with a patella cartilage hole. Since then, I’ve had stress fractures, tendonitis from my groin to my feet, chronic sprained ankles, muscle strains, you name it.  \\n I like to think that I’ve had enough bodily tweaks to realize that running cannot be intrinsically linked to my happiness.  \\n Yet, as I sit here, now almost two weeks after Western States, I’m not outstandingly happy. Yes, I’m bummed about the outcome of the race, but I’m more concerned with the fact that I’m still injured, and I don’t have a timeline for when I’ll be able to run, let alone train again.  \\n I try to think positively, knowing that I have time before CCC (a 100k version of UTMB in Chamonix, France on September 1<sup>st</sup>), but it’s hard to stay super duper happy when I can’t run. No matter how supposedly mature-with-injuries I become, I don’t think not being able to run will ever get any easier.  \\n So anyways, that’s where I’m at physically.\\n\\n### **Mental and Emotional Road to Recovery **\\n\\nI’ve been surrounded by dear friends and family since the race, had many laughs and fond recollections of the highlights of States.  \\n I’ve celebrated Cat’s win with our Boulder crowd of crazies, collectively relishing in her seminal accomplishment.  \\n I’ve also had many, many retellings, in person and via text, messenger, and email, of my final three or so miles when everything stopped.

DNFs force you to learn, whether you like it or not. I suppose I’m grateful for the forced looking back.  \\n One thing I didn’t expect from this race is my understanding of my mental-ness. I went into States a bit unsure of my fitness, as I knew I didn’t feel as strong as I had felt going into Leadville last year.  \\n I was dealing with a touch of chronic fatigue, unexplained high heart rates, a bit of manic moodiness, all mixed with really quality workouts. So the months leading up to States were a confusing smorgasbord of feedback that made me physically unsure entering States.  \\n Now, in hindsight, I realize that in order to compensate for my physical uncertainty, or maybe just lack of confidence, I knew everything would come down to what’s above my shoulders.\\n\\n### **Preparing With Blinders On **\\n\\nTwo weeks before States, I honed in more than I ever have in my life. I prepared my mind for States more thoroughly, but recklessly, than I knew I was capable of. It was not all for the better.  \\n I committed to doing-away with any and all fluff leading into the race, assuming I would have a heightened sense of clarity. I extinguished anything that I thought was a distraction.  \\n Running-wise, it worked. I went into the race extremely confident that my mental strength would make up for any physical deficits. The night before the race, I told myself I was capable of winning. That confidence came from my two-week crash course in self-belief and focus.  \\n During the race, I felt more challenged than I ever had in my life, but I stepped up to the plate, mile after mile, until I couldn’t out-mental the challenges anymore.  \\n Yet, in those weeks leading up to States, I didn’t process any emotions unrelated to the race, let alone ask myself if I was ignoring non-States related parts to my life, i.e. important relationships.  \\n Even though I can come across as a carefree jokester and as someone who doesn’t take herself too seriously when it comes to running, internally, I was far from that. Realizing, in hindsight, that I was far from balanced is almost as painful as my DNF.  \\n Thus, before my next big race, I aim to not shut out everything and anything unrelated to my mental race preparations.

Enjoy!\\n\\n1. Western States DNF recap.\\n2. Recovering (miraculously) and diving head first into the joys of summer Mountain Time.\\n3. Preparing for the rest of the summer: Latvia and CCC.\\n\\n#### Western States: What the heck happened?\\n\\nI was recently interviewed for The Trail Run Project about my DNF (link coming soon). Here’s part of the interview, which explains what actually happened in my final miles on the WS100 course.  \\n**What mile did you pull out of Western States?**  \\n It was around mile 93. I never made it to the aid at 94.3  \\n**Why did you have to drop out?**  \\n I started feeling something strange and tight in the back of my left leg around mile 70. I was rolling down the Cal Street section, feeling great otherwise and ignored it. As I was in third, ignoring issues like that at mile 70 in a 100 is justified, or so I thought. I was in the race to podium. But then around 85, the back of my knee became more painful. I knew it wasn’t a cramp, as I took copious HOTSHOT and salt pills and was eating and drinking really well all day, but especially since mile 70 when I felt that first twinge. I mustered from 85 to 89 still slowly running/jogging/fast walking, but it was excruciating. I was sobbing for most of it and grabbing the back of my leg, trying to get it to work normally without the sharp searing sensation.  \\n Then at 89, I didn’t take my time at the aid, as I knew I didn’t have much time on 4th. I walked out of the aid and then couldn’t run again. Walking lasted for a mile or so, then my inner groin on that same leg became numb. I couldn’t straighten my leg fully or bend it fully; it was stuck in this weird limbo. Without my groin/hip flexor to help hoist the leg up, I succumbed to literally side stepping, leading with my good leg, and essentially dragging my left leg. I sidestepped across Highway 94, sobbing, not knowing what was happening, nor why. The traffic control volunteers were very confused because I think I was still in 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> at that point. The whole time my pacer was being very kind, but she has had no clue what was going on and I couldn’t really talk that well because I was so upset.  \\n Then after Highway 94, the trail steepens into a rocky uphill section and I could no longer side step because I couldn’t hoist my bag leg up high enough. So I sat down on my butt and dragged my ass up the hill. Glamorous crawling. I made it maybe a half mile in 45-min. By this point, probably 50 runners had passed me. No one recognized me because I had put my pacer’s tee shirt on; I was shivering since I was moving so slowly. Then my pacer, being concerned, went up ahead to the aid station and returned with two medical volunteers. They warned me that if they touched me I’d be DQed. I said “no thank you” and tried to continue crawling up, hoisting my butt over the trail and dragging my legs behind. I’m guessing this was around mile 93. But, I couldn’t do it. I thought about how long it would take me to finish those 7 miles, and I doubted I could do it in under 10 hours at the rate I was going. The cut off would be long over by then. I acquiesced to help and the volunteers hoisted me back down to Highway 94 where eventually my parents picked me up.

Here’s part of the interview, which explains what actually happened in my final miles on the WS100 course.<br>\n<strong>What mile did you pull out of Western States?</strong><br>\nIt was around mile 93. I never made it to the aid at 94.3<br>\n<strong>Why did you have to drop out?</strong><br>\nI started feeling something strange and tight in the back of my left leg around mile 70. I was rolling down the Cal Street section, feeling great otherwise and ignored it. As I was in third, ignoring issues like that at mile 70 in a 100 is justified, or so I thought. I was in the race to podium. But then around 85, the back of my knee became more painful. I knew it wasn’t a cramp, as I took copious HOTSHOT and salt pills and was eating and drinking really well all day, but especially since mile 70 when I felt that first twinge. I mustered from 85 to 89 still slowly running/jogging/fast walking, but it was excruciating. I was sobbing for most of it and grabbing the back of my leg, trying to get it to work normally without the sharp searing sensation.<br>\nThen at 89, I didn’t take my time at the aid, as I knew I didn’t have much time on 4th. I walked out of the aid and then couldn’t run again. Walking lasted for a mile or so, then my inner groin on that same leg became numb. I couldn’t straighten my leg fully or bend it fully; it was stuck in this weird limbo. Without my groin/hip flexor to help hoist the leg up, I succumbed to literally side stepping, leading with my good leg, and essentially dragging my left leg. I sidestepped across Highway 94, sobbing, not knowing what was happening, nor why. The traffic control volunteers were very confused because I think I was still in 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> at that point.

So I sat down on my butt and dragged my ass up the hill. Glamorous crawling. I made it maybe a half mile in 45-min. By this point, probably 50 runners had passed me. No one recognized me because I had put my pacer’s tee shirt on; I was shivering since I was moving so slowly. Then my pacer, being concerned, went up ahead to the aid station and returned with two medical volunteers. They warned me that if they touched me I’d be DQed. I said “no thank you” and tried to continue crawling up, hoisting my butt over the trail and dragging my legs behind. I’m guessing this was around mile 93. But, I couldn’t do it. I thought about how long it would take me to finish those 7 miles, and I doubted I could do it in under 10 hours at the rate I was going. The cut off would be long over by then. I acquiesced to help and the volunteers hoisted me back down to Highway 94 where eventually my parents picked me up.

I’d like to think that I would’ve adjusted my summer plans with a smile on my face had my knee needed more time to heal—swimming every day and finding pleasure in non-running related activities—but I’ll be honest, nothing beats running in the mountains in the summer.  \\n Now, this may seem like a 100% fun and free and happy-go-lucky lifestyle. With the right mindset, it is. But to an outside observer, it’s anything but fun.  \\n A dear college friend, Nina, recently visited; she hadn’t witnessed my ultrarunning lifestyle yet and was surprised at some aspects of my lifestyle that I’ve grown to take as normal. I guess they’re not. So here’s to debunking the glamor of ultrarunning:\\n\\n1. It’s dirty. You want to run for a few days back to back while sleeping out of your car? Well, let me introduce you to a product: Wet Wipes.\\n\\nI’ve gone well over a week without looking in a mirror. That’s my new normal. It rocks. Obviously, sometimes, I could smell better.\\n\\n1. You must constantly plan, yet simultaneously be flexile, while sleep-deprived and hungry. In order to maximize weekend after long weekend after full week in the mountains, you’re perpetually planning ahead. Yet, you can’t really plan when you’re already running in the mountains, so you have to make loose plans, all of the time, remember dates and friends and logistics, and then be okay with falling short on logistics. Like who brought the Sriracha? Who brought a sleeping bag? Where are we sleeping? What mountain are we running today? Will I ever get to sleep 8 hours?\\n\\nThe beauty of warm weather running is nothing is terribly critical planning-wise, as long as you’re at a trailhead with some running shoes, a pack, some water and some calories. 90% of summer in the mountains is getting to the trailhead. Then it’s all sweat, laughs, maybe some blood and pain and dealing with injuries. Oh, and a shit ton of exercise. I guess since all of my trail running buddies are constantly running, I forget that’s not normal. A long day out in the mountains means you’re stoked on hiking for hours, being hungry or grumpy, hot and cold, and then slamming your body downhill for some more hours. Then sleeping on the ground. I swear, this IS THE LIFE. Did I mention wildflowers??\\n\\nThis chaotic mindset of non-stop thinking ahead, whilst being present in the moment and constantly moving could make you go crazy and want a weekend in bed. But, I warn you: in order to maximize summer, you must stave off any and all anti-stoke thoughts!! Every opportunity counts! You want that sunrise! I can’t tell you the last time I watched TV. I do moan over the fact I don’t have time to read as much as I’d like, but I’d take that any day over boredom.\\n\\n1. Trail running is comically inexpensive. I barely spend money except on food and gas. And acupuncture. When people in cities look forlornly at my weekends, lamenting at how they wish they could be in the mountains, I say WELL, WHY AREN’T YOU? A weekend in the mountains is grossly cheaper than a weekend barhopping and Uber/Lyft-ing. You carpool to trailheads, i.e. share gas, you eat gels and candy and stale tortilla chips. You rarely rent a place to sleep in on the weekends, because you’re in your car or tent. The argument for staying in an urban bar scene falls short to me, if you do, in fact, want to get outside.\\n\\nTo my friends and readers who don’t live close to mountains, I’m guessing you live close to *some *trails or wilderness. Get your planning and stoke shoes on, organize a crew, and get dirty. From my experience, there’s no chance you will regret it, even if you don’t see one wildflower.\\n\\nI’m so grateful to have the time, which is the most important aspect of my lifestyle right now, to be able to capitalize on mountain time in the summer.  \\n What’s up now: I’ve left Colorado for a college teammate’s wedding in Virginia (GO TIGERS), and then will go straight to Latvia (more on that soon) and then Chamonix, France to race CCC, the 100k version of UTMB. I’m eager to get to Europe, but also know that a grimy, chaotic Colorado mountain weekend is where my heart is. I’m okay with my new normal. 🙂  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1141\\\" style=\\\"width: 2448px\\\">![IMG_0485](/content/images/2017/08/img_0485.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Abby doesn’t need a mirror to tell her she’s ready to run. </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1194\\\" style=\\\"width: 2448px\\\">![IMG_0737](/content/images/2017/08/img_0737.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">I promise the photos get better… </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1195\\\" style=\\\"width: 2448px\\\">![IMG_0769](/content/images/2017/08/img_0769.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">You can’t run if you’re not able to run… </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1196\\\" style=\\\"width: 720px\\\">![IMG_0774](/content/images/2017/08/img_0774.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Being stoked, and committing to exercise, when you can’t run is imperative for general well being. </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1142\\\" style=\\\"width: 2448px\\\">![IMG_0683](/content/images/2017/08/img_0683.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Guy doesn’t care that he’s dirty and he just got a new tattoo! </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1144\\\" style=\\\"width: 1280px\\\">![IMG_0714](/content/images/2017/08/img_0714.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">As long as they’re weird, you should hang out with them. </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1145\\\" style=\\\"width: 1080px\\\">![IMG_0736](/content/images/2017/08/img_0736.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">The most special of places in Colorado. </figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1147\\\" style=\\\"width: 742px\\\">![IMG_0748](/content/images/2017/08/img_0748.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Hiking with Guy Love.

I’d like to think that I would’ve adjusted my summer plans with a smile on my face had my knee needed more time to heal—swimming every day and finding pleasure in non-running related activities—but I’ll be honest, nothing beats running in the mountains in the summer.<br>\nNow, this may seem like a 100% fun and free and happy-go-lucky lifestyle. With the right mindset, it is. But to an outside observer, it’s anything but fun.<br>\nA dear college friend, Nina, recently visited; she hadn’t witnessed my ultrarunning lifestyle yet and was surprised at some aspects of my lifestyle that I’ve grown to take as normal. I guess they’re not. So here’s to debunking the glamor of ultrarunning:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s dirty. You want to run for a few days back to back while sleeping out of your car? Well, let me introduce you to a product: Wet Wipes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’ve gone well over a week without looking in a mirror. That’s my new normal. It rocks. Obviously, sometimes, I could smell better.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You must constantly plan, yet simultaneously be flexile, while sleep-deprived and hungry. In order to maximize weekend after long weekend after full week in the mountains, you’re perpetually planning ahead. Yet, you can’t really plan when you’re already running in the mountains, so you have to make loose plans, all of the time, remember dates and friends and logistics, and then be okay with falling short on logistics. Like who brought the Sriracha? Who brought a sleeping bag? Where are we sleeping? What mountain are we running today? Will I ever get to sleep 8 hours?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The beauty of warm weather running is nothing is terribly critical planning-wise, as long as you’re at a trailhead with some running shoes, a pack, some water and some calories. 90% of summer in the mountains is getting to the trailhead. Then it’s all sweat, laughs, maybe some blood and pain and dealing with injuries. Oh, and a shit ton of exercise. I guess since all of my trail running buddies are constantly running, I forget that’s not normal. A long day out in the mountains means you’re stoked on hiking for hours, being hungry or grumpy, hot and cold, and then slamming your body downhill for some more hours. Then sleeping on the ground. I swear, this IS THE LIFE. Did I mention wildflowers??</p>\n<p>This chaotic mindset of non-stop thinking ahead, whilst being present in the moment and constantly moving could make you go crazy and want a weekend in bed. But, I warn you: in order to maximize summer, you must stave off any and all anti-stoke thoughts!! Every opportunity counts! You want that sunrise! I can’t tell you the last time I watched TV. I do moan over the fact I don’t have time to read as much as I’d like, but I’d take that any day over boredom.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trail running is comically inexpensive. I barely spend money except on food and gas. And acupuncture. When people in cities look forlornly at my weekends, lamenting at how they wish they could be in the mountains, I say WELL, WHY AREN’T YOU? A weekend in the mountains is grossly cheaper than a weekend barhopping and Uber/Lyft-ing. You carpool to trailheads, i.e. share gas, you eat gels and candy and stale tortilla chips. You rarely rent a place to sleep in on the weekends, because you’re in your car or tent. The argument for staying in an urban bar scene falls short to me, if you do, in fact, want to get outside.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To my friends and readers who don’t live close to mountains, I’m guessing you live close to *some *trails or wilderness. Get your planning and stoke shoes on, organize a crew, and get dirty. From my experience, there’s no chance you will regret it, even if you don’t see one wildflower.</p>\n<p>I’m so grateful to have the time, which is the most important aspect of my lifestyle right now, to be able to capitalize on mountain time in the summer.<br>\nWhat’s up now: I’ve left Colorado for a college teammate’s wedding in Virginia (GO TIGERS), and then will go straight to Latvia (more on that soon) and then Chamonix, France to race CCC, the 100k version of UTMB. I’m eager to get to Europe, but also know that a grimy, chaotic Colorado mountain weekend is where my heart is.

Considering the website didn’t have distances for the races, just animal pseudonyms that I was incapable of understanding or translating, it was a small miracle I ended up racing at all. Week of the race, I discovered that the 30km ‘bobcat’ (~19 miles) was the longest race, which was a perfect distance for my training leading up to [CCC](http://utmbmontblanc.com/en/page/21/21.html) (the 100k of Ultra de Mt.

In Shenandoah, I enjoyed two rainy, but good, runs, which sandwiched a less than awesome back-seat car sleep.  \\n From D.C. I had a long layover in Frankfurt. Unlike most long layovers, I was stoked about this because I’d read about a trail system a mere mile from the airport. To anyone considering a long layover in Frankfurt to run: do it! But, you don’t have to take a hotel bus to get to the trails, as other blogs suggest online, just Google map “[hotel steigenberger Frankfurt airport](https://www.google.lv/maps/place/Steigenberger+Airport+Hotel/@50.0584798,8.5282546,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xe79f075b490814d5!8m2!3d50.0584798!4d8.5895377),” run there, and you’ll be at the trails. It’s so close, taking a bus is a waste of time; I tried. Just run!  \\n Anyways, Latvia is eerily quite and serene. Upon arriving late at night, I took a taxi to the countryside near where my race would be. I slept in a trailer cottage abode thingy and felt like I was in the middle of nowhere, which was later corroborated by a Latvian friend who said most of the country is extremely sparsely populated countryside. The entire country has less than half as many people as Colorado (under 2 million versus over 5 million)! Latvia, square mileage-wise, is about the size of West Virginia. It’s a small place.  \\n One quirk about Latvians I immediately noticed: they love sports. When my cab driver, who spoke hardly a lick of English, realized I was from the U.S., and then Colorado, said,  \\n “Colorado, Avalanche, hockey!” I was aghast.  \\n “[Sandis Ozoliņš](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandis_Ozoli%C5%86%C5%A1), he play for Avalanche and from Latvia!”  \\n “You like hockey?”  \\n “Oh yes!”  \\n The rest of our hour-long ride was silent.  \\n Then, upon waking up on the farm, all that was visible other than farmland, large homes with exquisite potted flowers on every porch–albeit there are maybe 10 homes per square mile–were soccer and volleyball nets.  \\n After my race, I spoke with the woman who placed second—she was a godsend of a translator—and she said, “I grew up in the countryside and when you live in the countryside you have nothing to do.

It was steep, but I can’t say I’ll be going back to Latvia in the winter to send it.  \\n The race start was energetic and beyond confusing. There were supposedly 2,000 people running all of the races, from a 5k to my 30k race. It was the strangest juxtaposition to go from seeing hardly anyone to seeing, and mainly hearing, so many Latvians. They love music and their local music sounds like a Viking chant mixed with Top 40, but mainly just Viking drumming. It permeated my soul in the hours surrounding the race. And after a [little reading,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia) I learned that Latvian music is one of the reasons the country has kept its identity throughout centuries of foreign rule.  \\n Once we all counted down in Latvian, us lead runners ran a raucously fast first two miles on pavement exiting the village. Upon entering the forest, I slowed my pace, and even though no less than five men surrounded me during the first five miles of the race, and the quiet spell of the country returned.  \\n It wasn’t like most trail races that have pleasant banter. Everyone was serious. I’d say “Good job” to guys passing me; but, always, no response. Except for one man. We raced the last third of the race together and he encouraged me in Latvian, I’d mumble back in English. He eventually got sick of me, or so I presume, and charged ahead. I got the feeling that Latvian men are not used to women being at the lead of the pack.  \\n The flora was indulgent and the trails were deliciously soft; we often ran directly on moss carpeting the trail, or on a trail so skinny that little fern bushes covered it completely from eyesight.

You can see my run [here](https://www.strava.com/activities/1141005656).  \\n There were no long stretches of anything monotonous.

Today, younger generations are much more likely to speak English, but not Russian. Regardless, Soviet Rule thankfully didn’t destroy Latvian forest, as most of the country has primary forest still intact.  \\n I was exhausted throughout the race thanks to the fast start and thanks to jet lag.

National Monument designation has been a gateway for National Park designation, which is hugely important for anyone who cares about protecting lands of historical, cultural and scientific interest.  \\n I’ll cut to the chase. **Trump asked Zinke to review 27 of these monuments to see if they could be shrunk.

The facts of his visits are clear: he mainly met with opponents of national monuments, “[including representatives of the oil, gas and timber industries. He arbitrarily “pardoned” six national monuments, without providing any criteria for his decisions to leave current protections in place](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2017/national-monuments-08-24-2017.php).” Such a pardoning is a win for the monuments, but where’s his reasoning?

The Act authorizes the President singular authority to designate national monuments without public comment, environmental review, or further consent of Congress. Given this extraordinary executive power, Congress wisely placed limits on the President by defining the objects that may be included within a monument as being “historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest,” by restricting the authority to Federal lands, and by limiting the size of the monument to “the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects.” Congress retained its authority to make land use designations without such limitations. Even with the restrictive language, use of the Act has not always been without controversy. In fact, even Theodore Roosevelt’s first proclamation of the roughly 1,200 acre Devil’s Tower in Wyoming was controversial. Since that time, the use of the Act has largely been viewed as an overwhelming American success story and today includes almost 200 of America’s greatest treasures.\\n\\n#### More recently, however, the Act’s executive authority is under scrutiny as administrations have expanded both the size and scope of monument designations. Since 1996 alone, the Act has been used by the President 26 times to create monuments that are over 100,000 acres or more in size and have included private property within the identified external boundaries. While early monument designations focused more on geological formations, archaeological ruins, and areas of historical interest, a more recent and broad interpretation of what constitutes an “object of historic or scientific interest” has been extended to include landscape areas, biodiversity, and view sheds. Moreover, features such as World War II desert bombing craters and remoteness have been included in justifying proclamations.\\n\\n#### The responsibility of protecting America’s public lands and unique antiquities should not be taken lightly; nor should the authority and the power granted to a President under the Act. No President should use the authority under the Act to restrict public access, prevent hunting and fishing, burden private land, or eliminate traditional land uses, unless such action is needed to protect the object. It is Congress and not the President that has the authority to make protective land designations outside of the narrow scope of the Act, and only Congress retains the authority to enact designations such as national parks, wilderness, and national conservation and recreation areas. The executive power under the Act is not a substitute for a lack of congressional action on protective land designations.\\n\\n#### President Trump was correct in tasking the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to review and provide recommendations of all monuments that were designated from 1996 to the present that are 100,000 acres or greater in size or made without adequate public consultation. This is far from the first time an examination of scope of monuments has been conducted. Existing monuments have been modified by successive Presidents in the past, including 18 reductions in the size of monuments, and there is no doubt that President Trump has the authority to review and consider recommendations to modify or add a monument.\\n\\n#### The methodology used for the review consisted of three steps. The first step was to gather the facts which included the examination of existing proclamations, object(s) to be protected, segregation of the objects (if practical) to meet the “smallest area compatible” requirement, the scientific and rational basis for the boundaries, land uses within the monument, public access concerns and authorized traditional uses, and appropriate environmental and cultural protections. As directed by the President, the second step was to ensure that the local voice was heard by holding meetings with local, state, tribal, and other elected officials as well as meetings with non-profit groups and other stakeholders, as well as providing an online format for public comment. The final step was to review policies on public access, hunting and fishing rights, traditional use such as timber production and grazing, economic and environmental impacts, potential legal conflicts, and provide a report to the President no later than August 24, 2017\\n\\n#### <span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\">The review found that each monument was unique in terms of the object(s) used for justification, proclamation language, history, management plans, economic impact, and local support.</span><span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\">Adherence to the Act’s definition of an “object” and “smallest area compatible” clause on some monuments were either arbitrary or likely politically motivated or boundaries could not be supported by science or reasons of practical resource management. Despite the apparent lack of adherence to the purpose of the Act, some monuments reflect a long public debate process and are largely settled and strongly supported by the local community. Other monuments remain controversial and contain significant private property within the identified external boundary or overlap with other Federal land designations such as national forests, Wilderness Study Areas, and lands specifically set aside by Congress for timber production.</span>\\n\\n#### Public comments can be divided into two principal groups.<span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\"> Proponents tended to promote monument designation as a mechanism to prevent the sale or transfer of public land. This narrative is false and has no basis in fact. Public lands within a monument are federally owned and managed regardless of monument designation under the Act. Proponents also point to the economic benefits from increased tourism from monument recognition. On this point, monument status has a potential economic benefit of increased visitation, particularly to service related industries, outdoor recreation industries, and other businesses dependent or supported by tourism. Increased visitation also places an additional burden and responsibility on the Federal Government to provide additional resources and manpower to maintain these lands to better support increased visitation and recreational activities.</span>\\n\\n#### <span style=\\\"text-decoration:underline;\\\">Comments received were overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining existing monuments and demonstrated a well orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple organizations. Opponents of monuments primarily supported rescinding or modifying the existing monuments to protect traditional multiple use, and those most concerned were often local residents associated with industries such as grazing, timber production, mining, hunting and fishing, and motorized recreation. Opponents point to other cases where monument designation has resulted in reduced public access, road closures, hunting and fishing restrictions, multiple and confusing management plans, reduced grazing allotments and timber production, and pressure applied to private land owners encompassed by or adjacent to a monument to sell.</span>\\n\\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_media-5\\\" style=\\\"width: 4480px\\\">![Clare Gallagher-11.jpg](/content/images/2017/08/clare-gallagher-11.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">I’m not effing around, people, we shouldn’t be complacent.

Given this extraordinary executive\npower, Congress wisely placed limits on the President by defining the objects\nthat may be included within a monument as being “historic landmarks, historic\nand prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific\ninterest,” by restricting the authority to Federal lands, and by limiting the\nsize of the monument to “the smallest area compatible with proper care and\nmanagement of the objects.” Congress retained its authority to make land use\ndesignations without such limitations. Even with the restrictive language, use\nof the Act has not always been without controversy. In fact, even Theodore\nRoosevelt’s first proclamation of the roughly 1,200 acre Devil’s Tower in\nWyoming was controversial. Since that time, the use of the Act has largely been\nviewed as an overwhelming American success story and today includes almost 200\nof America’s greatest treasures.\nMore recently, however, the Act’s executive authority is under scrutiny as\nadministrations have expanded both the size and scope of monument designations.\nSince 1996 alone, the Act has been used by the President 26 times to create\nmonuments that are over 100,000 acres or more in size and have included private\nproperty within the identified external boundaries. While early monument\ndesignations focused more on geological formations, archaeological ruins, and\nareas of historical interest, a more recent and broad interpretation of what\nconstitutes an “object of historic or scientific interest” has been extended to\ninclude landscape areas, biodiversity, and view sheds. Moreover, features such\nas World War II desert bombing craters and remoteness have been included in\njustifying proclamations.\nThe responsibility of protecting America’s public lands and unique antiquities\nshould not be taken lightly; nor should the authority and the power granted to a\nPresident under the Act. No President should use the authority under the Act to\nrestrict public access, prevent hunting and fishing, burden private land, or\neliminate traditional land uses, unless such action is needed to protect the\nobject. It is Congress and not the President that has the authority to make\nprotective land designations outside of the narrow scope of the Act, and only\nCongress retains the authority to enact designations such as national parks,\nwilderness, and national conservation and recreation areas. The executive power\nunder the Act is not a substitute for a lack of congressional action on\nprotective land designations.\nPresident Trump was correct in tasking the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary)\nto review and provide recommendations of all monuments that were designated from\n1996 to the present that are 100,000 acres or greater in size or made without\nadequate public consultation. This is far from the first time an examination of\nscope of monuments has been conducted. Existing monuments have been modified by\nsuccessive Presidents in the past, including 18 reductions in the size of\nmonuments, and there is no doubt that President Trump has the authority to\nreview and consider recommendations to modify or add a monument.\nThe methodology used for the review consisted of three steps. The first step was\nto gather the facts which included the examination of existing proclamations,\nobject(s) to be protected, segregation of the objects (if practical) to meet the\n“smallest area compatible” requirement, the scientific and rational basis for\nthe boundaries, land uses within the monument, public access concerns and\nauthorized traditional uses, and appropriate environmental and cultural\nprotections. As directed by the President, the second step was to ensure that\nthe local voice was heard by holding meetings with local, state, tribal, and\nother elected officials as well as meetings with non-profit groups and other\nstakeholders, as well as providing an online format for public comment. The\nfinal step was to review policies on public access, hunting and fishing rights,\ntraditional use such as timber production and grazing, economic and\nenvironmental impacts, potential legal conflicts, and provide a report to the\nPresident no later than August 24, 2017\nThe review found that each monument was unique in terms of the object(s) used\nfor justification, proclamation language, history, management plans, economic\nimpact, and local support.Adherence to the Act’s definition of an “object” and\n“smallest area compatible” clause on some monuments were either arbitrary or\nlikely politically motivated or boundaries could not be supported by science or\nreasons of practical resource management. Despite the apparent lack of adherence\nto the purpose of the Act, some monuments reflect a long public debate process\nand are largely settled and strongly supported by the local community. Other\nmonuments remain controversial and contain significant private property within\nthe identified external boundary or overlap with other Federal land designations\nsuch as national forests, Wilderness Study Areas, and lands specifically set\naside by Congress for timber production.\nPublic comments can be divided into two principal groups.  Proponents tended to\npromote monument designation as a mechanism to prevent the sale or transfer of\npublic land. This narrative is false and has no basis in fact. Public lands\nwithin a monument are federally owned and managed regardless of monument\ndesignation under the Act. Proponents also point to the economic benefits from\nincreased tourism from monument recognition. On this point, monument status has\na potential economic benefit of increased visitation, particularly to service\nrelated industries, outdoor recreation industries, and other businesses\ndependent or supported by tourism. Increased visitation also places an\nadditional burden and responsibility on the Federal Government to provide\nadditional resources and manpower to maintain these lands to better support\nincreased visitation and recreational activities.\nComments received were overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining existing monuments\nand demonstrated a well orchestrated national campaign organized by multiple\norganizations. Opponents of monuments primarily supported rescinding or\nmodifying the existing monuments to protect traditional multiple use, and those\nmost concerned were often local residents associated with industries such as\ngrazing, timber production, mining, hunting and fishing, and motorized\nrecreation. Opponents point to other cases where monument designation has\nresulted in reduced public access, road closures, hunting and fishing\nrestrictions, multiple and confusing management plans, reduced grazing\nallotments and timber production, and pressure applied to private land owners\nencompassed by or adjacent to a monument to sell.\n![Clare\nGallagher-11.jpg](/content/images/2017/08/clare-gallagher-11.jpg)\nI’m not effing around, people, we shouldn’t be complacent.

And talking in this post-race [I Run Far interview](https://www.irunfar.com/2017/09/clare-gallagher-2017-ccc-champ-interview.html). And [UltraRunnerPodcast](http://ultrarunnerpodcast.com/clare-gallagher-2017-ccc/).  \\n In case you’re still curious, here are some of my own musings about the start and end of my CCC race. I have much more to say in general, especially about how much I thought about [my motivations](https://claregallagherruns.wordpress.com/2017/08/26/what-is-happening-with-our-national-monuments-my-cccutmb-motivation/) during those 12 hours. But for now, here’s just a tidbit about the race itself.\\n\\n### **The Climb Out of Courmayer, Italy**\\n\\nI started with poles up the first, largest climb of the race. I was hauling ass. But near the top of the mountain, [Maite Maiora](http://www.irunfar.com/2017/05/maite-maiora-2017-zegama-aizkorri-marathon-champion-interview.html) passed me like I was standing still. Now for context, I shouldn’t have been surprised considering this woman has been unbeatable in recent years. Still, I stupidly asked, “Where are you from?” A guy behind both of us yelled proudly, “Espana!” I hunkered down for what I accurately surmised would be a long, painful, but exuberating race ahead.  \\n Maite opted for the power-hike-hands-on-knees method to climb. I glared at my poles and realized they weren’t helping me. Back home on my Colorado training grounds, I reluctantly practiced with poles a handful of times and thought it sufficed as adequate pole training for CCC. It didn’t. I put the sticks away and didn’t take them out again until the tail end of the last climb.\\n\\n### >>Fast forward 90 kilometers, three countries, a liter of Coca Cola and 35 Honey Stinger gels.<<** **\\n\\n### **The Climb Up Flégère and Descent Into Chamonix, France **\\n\\nBy the end of the last climb, I was leading the race, but running more scared than I ever had run in my life. I envisioned Maite just seconds behind me, waiting to pounce. I knew the poles would help me run up the final part of the douche grade climb, and they did.  \\n Note: ‘douche grade’ means a steep climb, but not steep enough that you can’t run. Road or track runners turned trail runner usually love douche grades because they’re monotonous slogs and pure fitness testers.  \\n Yet, at the end of a 100k in the Alps, running any grade was pretty difficult. I’m sure that most people power-hiked that climb on Flégère, yet, I couldn’t bear the thought of hiking so I whipped out my poles and ran. Thank you to [Zach Miller](http://trailrunner.com/trail-news/a-conversation-with-trail-running-speedster-zach-miller/) for giving me this advice before the race: when he won CCC in 2015, he didn’t use poles at all, but said they would have been useful on that last climb. Zach, you couldn’t have been more right.  \\n I think I surprised the lone spectator on that climb—a nice British man named David who told me it wasn’t far till the top. I was practically whining “Are you sure? 400 meters? What’s your name?” I have no clue what he looked like because it was already dark and the air was pure white mist. I could barely see five feet ahead of me. Not that it really mattered because I was just focusing on moving as fast as humanly possible and one eye had been fuzzy for the past 20 miles after taking a hard fall in a downhill section of mud hell. My eye with the clean contact focused on the rocks below my little feet that were pattering away slowly, but laboriously—the way one finishes an ultra even when leading. I thought to myself: I can’t be preyed upon. I won’t let up.  \\n I hit the top of the last climb, still unaware of how close Maite was, but determined that there was no possible way for her to catch me if I: 1) didn’t fall, and 2) went all out.  \\n Coalescing these two objectives in a two-foot visibility misty darkness wasn’t the easiest task in the world. I had to take my headlamp off my head and hold it directly above my feet to ensure that I could see the trail and stay upright. In doing so, I froze my hand solid, but remembered that mountaineers get frost bitten hands and feet often and still summit; thus, I sucked up my chilly thumb. Going all out meant that I was repeating to myself over and over “Keep on going. Don’t slow down. It’s impossible she’ll catch you.”  \\n This slew of positive mantras is how I operate best while racing and it proved to work well at CCC.  \\n Exiting the trail section into the edge of Chamonix was one of the more surreal experiences of my life. It gives me chills writing about it now. The course changed from a eerily lonely and quiet forest pain cave of misty darkness to a glowing, energy teeming city of incoherent ultrarunning fans.  \\n At this point, I knew I’d won the race and an Italian friend Paco was on the pavement with other cheerers to confirm that I only had a few minutes of running through the crowd-laden streets before crossing the finish line.  \\n I thought to myself, “Am I going to cry?” But I didn’t feel anything related to happy tears; I was too tired and had no energy for emotion. Well, I guess I had just enough energy to dance and high-five my way through that final chute and to grin like a loopy puppy.  \\n I can’t wait till I’m once again a loopy puppy in Chamonix.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1304\\\" style=\\\"width: 2000px\\\">![CD2A0833](/content/images/2017/09/cd2a0833.jpeg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">PC: Guillem Casanova Bosch</figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1302\\\" style=\\\"width: 2000px\\\">![166A0360](/content/images/2017/09/166a0360.jpeg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">PC: Guillem Casanova Bosch</figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1308\\\" style=\\\"width: 4608px\\\">![IMG_4740](/content/images/2017/09/img_4740.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Super crew Dad!</figcaption></figure>  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1313\\\" style=\\\"width: 2000px\\\">![166A0353](/content/images/2017/09/166a0353.jpeg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Mid race chaos.

But for now, here’s just a tidbit about the race itself.\n\nThe Climb Out of Courmayer, Italy\nI started with poles up the first, largest climb of the race. I was hauling ass.\nBut near the top of the mountain, Maite Maiora\n[http://www.irunfar.com/2017/05/maite-maiora-2017-zegama-aizkorri-marathon-champion-interview.html] \n passed me like I was standing still. Now for context, I shouldn’t have been\nsurprised considering this woman has been unbeatable in recent years. Still, I\nstupidly asked, “Where are you from?” A guy behind both of us yelled proudly,\n“Espana!” I hunkered down for what I accurately surmised would be a long,\npainful, but exuberating race ahead.\nMaite opted for the power-hike-hands-on-knees method to climb. I glared at my\npoles and realized they weren’t helping me. Back home on my Colorado training\ngrounds, I reluctantly practiced with poles a handful of times and thought it\nsufficed as adequate pole training for CCC. It didn’t. I put the sticks away and\ndidn’t take them out again until the tail end of the last climb.\n\n>>Fast forward 90 kilometers, three countries, a liter of Coca Cola and 35 Honey\nStinger gels.<<** **\n**The Climb Up Flégère and Descent Into Chamonix, France **\nBy the end of the last climb, I was leading the race, but running more scared\nthan I ever had run in my life. I envisioned Maite just seconds behind me,\nwaiting to pounce. I knew the poles would help me run up the final part of the\ndouche grade climb, and they did.\nNote: ‘douche grade’ means a steep climb, but not steep enough that you can’t\nrun. Road or track runners turned trail runner usually love douche grades\nbecause they’re monotonous slogs and pure fitness testers.\nYet, at the end of a 100k in the Alps, running any grade was pretty difficult.\nI’m sure that most people power-hiked that climb on Flégère, yet, I couldn’t\nbear the thought of hiking so I whipped out my poles and ran. Thank you to Zach\nMiller\n[http://trailrunner.com/trail-news/a-conversation-with-trail-running-speedster-zach-miller/] \n for giving me this advice before the race: when he won CCC in 2015, he didn’t\nuse poles at all, but said they would have been useful on that last climb. Zach,\nyou couldn’t have been more right.\nI think I surprised the lone spectator on that climb—a nice British man named\nDavid who told me it wasn’t far till the top. I was practically whining “Are you\nsure? 400 meters? What’s your name?” I have no clue what he looked like because\nit was already dark and the air was pure white mist. I could barely see five\nfeet ahead of me. Not that it really mattered because I was just focusing on\nmoving as fast as humanly possible and one eye had been fuzzy for the past 20\nmiles after taking a hard fall in a downhill section of mud hell. My eye with\nthe clean contact focused on the rocks below my little feet that were pattering\naway slowly, but laboriously—the way one finishes an ultra even when leading. I\nthought to myself: I can’t be preyed upon. I won’t let up.\nI hit the top of the last climb, still unaware of how close Maite was, but\ndetermined that there was no possible way for her to catch me if I: 1) didn’t\nfall, and 2) went all out.\nCoalescing these two objectives in a two-foot visibility misty darkness wasn’t\nthe easiest task in the world. I had to take my headlamp off my head and hold it\ndirectly above my feet to ensure that I could see the trail and stay upright. In\ndoing so, I froze my hand solid, but remembered that mountaineers get frost\nbitten hands and feet often and still summit; thus, I sucked up my chilly thumb.\nGoing all out meant that I was repeating to myself over and over “Keep on going.\nDon’t slow down. It’s impossible she’ll catch you.”\nThis slew of positive mantras is how I operate best while racing and it proved\nto work well at CCC.\nExiting the trail section into the edge of Chamonix was one of the more surreal\nexperiences of my life. It gives me chills writing about it now. The course\nchanged from a eerily lonely and quiet forest pain cave of misty darkness to a\nglowing, energy teeming city of incoherent ultrarunning fans.\nAt this point, I knew I’d won the race and an Italian friend Paco was on the\npavement with other cheerers to confirm that I only had a few minutes of running\nthrough the crowd-laden streets before crossing the finish line.\nI thought to myself, “Am I going to cry?” But I didn’t feel anything related to\nhappy tears; I was too tired and had no energy for emotion. Well, I guess I had\njust enough energy to dance and high-five my way through that final chute and to\ngrin like a loopy puppy.\nI can’t wait till I’m once again a loopy puppy in Chamonix.\n\n![CD2A0833](/content/images/2017/09/cd2a0833.jpeg)\nPC: Guillem Casanova Bosch\n![166A0360](/content/images/2017/09/166a0360.jpeg)\nPC: Guillem Casanova Bosch\n![IMG_4740](/content/images/2017/09/img_4740.jpg)\nSuper crew Dad!\n![166A0353](/content/images/2017/09/166a0353.jpeg)\nMid race chaos.

It’s been a strange few years being in Colorado—which is a strange statement itself because Colorado is my home—but my adult life took hold on coral reefs, not in the mountains. My passion for climate change mitigation wasn’t born in the Rockies, but in Bermuda and Palau where I spent two formidable summers mainly underwater.

No one journals when they’re happy, right? It’s always when we’re confused, upset, hurt, or mad. I never find myself scribbling, “I HAD THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE TODAY.” Maybe unless I’m traveling alone, but for me these days, that’s rare.  \\n A few days ago, I came across my journal from last summer when I was taking organic chemistry II in order to apply to medical school. In it, I found a written account of my thought process behind deciding to take a big risk, i.e. drop organic chemistry and not apply to medical school. I’m sharing it here because I think it could be useful for anyone else toiling with a “Should I quit my job? Should I go on that trip? Am I happy?” type of questioning journey. My advice? Write a pro/con list.  \\n Some background: I’d taken almost every other pre-requisite for medical school as an undergrad at Princeton as a biology major, but I had a few more classes to knock off before I could apply. One of the classes was organic chemistry II. I enrolled in the accelerated version of the course at CU Boulder thinking I could jump right in, without any refresher of organic chemistry I. I was brash in thinking I didn’t need to prepare at all. I’d completely forgotten that organic chemistry I at Princeton was the bane of my existence, that I’d gotten a 24% on my final, that I gave up entirely, but somehow managed to scrounge a C in the course–my only C at Princeton.  \\n Leading up to organic chemistry II at CU, I reviewed nothing. Instead, I galavanted, err ran, in the mountains every spare moment when I wasn’t scribing in emergency rooms–another medical school pre-requisite if I wanted to get into a top tier school because I had no prior clinical experience. My summer is best described as a sleepless running party with smatterings of 12-hour emergency room scribe shifts. I was far from an all-star scribe.  \\n Organic chemistry II started. I couldn’t even remember what an aldehyde or alcohol or keytone was. My notes were disorganized, frantic, scared. I was writing everything down, soon to stop writing anything down because I couldn’t discern what was from organic I, what was new and what was from general chemistry. Taking Japanese III would’ve felt the same.  \\n Everyone else in the class had just finished the accelerated version of organic I. Everyone else was fresh, dialed and motivated to finish organic II, to make their summer spent indoors worth it. By day three, I knew I was in over my head. I continued run, but adding in lectures and the three-hour labs three times a week compromised my health. I felt like I was back at Princeton–sleep starved, food starved, happiness starved–except this was way, way worse because I didn’t know why I was willingly doing this.  \\n At Princeton, it was just par for the course. Everyone suffers similarly and doesn’t sleep and no one questions the “why?” But now, years removed from that, um, unhealthy lifestyle, I questioned whether I did in fact want to become a doctor. To most people, the answer is easy: suck it up, sweetheart and finish the damn course. But, I wasn’t the same person I was as a 21-year-old. Years removed from the Ivy-League mentality, I put an invaluable price-tag on my time spent outdoors and wasn’t willing to budge.  \\n I dropped the course, less than two weeks in.I decided that I’d find another way to help people, while still being able to run in the mountains.  \\n Leadville happened a few weeks afterwards, which seemed to justify my decision.

Although public land protection is absolutely imperative, halting climate change is the most important thing humans must do. Nothing really matters unless we don’t halt climate change. This means electing public officials who have the power to make legislation that’ll guarantee change.  \\n – First time in my life I’ve been OUTRAGEOUSLY fired up to get involved politically. I realize the next three years are everything when it comes to electing legislators (governors, senators, city council members, representatives, *a president*) who care about our planet’s future. We have to hustle.

At least for a few\nmonths… I took rest seriously after CCC and quelled some knee problems that had\narisen during the race. REST IS GOOD. REST IS NECESSARY.\n\n![IMG_0435](/content/images/2017/10/img_0435.jpg)\nPC: Mike Thurk  \n– First time that I trusted my coach as much as I trusted my own body. I’m so\ngrateful for [David Roche’s](https://swaprunning.com/) patience in coaching me,\nwhich has now for almost a whole year. I know that I’m not the most coachable\nrunner, but he’s adjusted my needs and tendencies to his own coaching.Here’s a\nbrief recap of my training from CCC (September 1st) to TNF50 (this Saturday\nNovember 18th) Note: TNF50 is short for The North Face 50-miler Championships in\nSan Francisco. Preview here\n[http://www.irunfar.com/2017/11/2017-the-north-face-50-mile-championships-womens-preview.html]\n.\n\nI took almost three weeks off after CCC. As mentioned, rest and also acupuncture\n[http://www.boulderacusport.com/]  worked wonders on my mountain-ravaged body.\nThen, like a whale coming up for air, resuming running again felt necessary,\nnatural and fun. David has given me succinct, killer workouts and has let me\nfill in the rest. We’ve learned to work well off of this loose direction. My\nweekly workouts are spotlights in my mind, but I don’t worry about them until\nthe morning of said workout, I read my Google Doc (“Adventure Log,” as David\ntitles it) and then do the effort. The other days, I listen to my soul (or my\ntraining partners). I feel fit, albeit exhausted from so much travel. That leads\nme to another first:\n\n– First time in my life that I realized I don’t want to travel non-stop.\nNaturally, I had this epiphany while I was traveling non-stop. I have never\nyearned for a stable lifestyle before; it’s always been the opposite: What next?\nWhat new place? Where can I travel? Now, I firmly believe that I will be a\nbetter person if I travel with more intention, which will mean traveling less\nfrequently and working harder to make change at home in Colorado.\n– First time I used my car as a home base for a month. I spent most of October\nin Arizona:\n\n– Flagstaff for Rob Krar’s Ultra Camp [https://robkrar.com/camps/], which I\nhighly recommend to anybody who likes to run on trails, eat amazing food, and\nbefriend interesting, delightful people. One such person was Houda, the race\ndirector of TransRockies, [http://transrockies-run.com/] which I’m psyched to\nrun in 2018!\n\n![IMG_3024.jpg](/content/images/2017/11/img_3024.jpg)\nRob Krar being Rob Krar (Sedona, AZ).– Sedona for The North Face Athlete Summit,\nwhich was a week of raucous activity, desert reflection and contagious\ninspiration. The North Face Athlete Team could be described as people who live\nlife to the absolute tippy, tippy-top fullest of the most overflowing glass of\nlife’s liquids.\n![IMG_3374.jpg](/content/images/2017/11/img_3374.jpg)\nTNF ultrarunner (ultra-shredder) Rory Bosio.\n![IMG_3371.jpg](/content/images/2017/11/img_3371.jpg)\nTNF team captain Conrad Anker hiking Mt. Wilson in Sedona.– Sonoran National\nMonument, because why not sleep in the desert in the middle of nowhere en route\nto picking up my brother, Eric, who was jumping out of airplanes on the Mexico\nborder.\n\n![IMG_3230.jpg](/content/images/2017/11/img_3230.jpg)\nWhen’s the last time you’ve visited a new national monument? It’s guaranteed to\nbe fun!–[Chiricahua National Monument](https://www.nps.gov/chir/index.htm) for a\n30-km race with Eric. Neither of us got hurt! The voodoo rocks are incredible.\n[Bucket-list race](http://www.rocamotion.com/inaugural-boulder-dash-13k30k/).\n![IMG_3295.jpg](/content/images/2017/11/img_3295.jpg)\nAfter winning the 30k in southeast Arizona.\n![IMG_3284.jpg](/content/images/2017/11/img_3284.jpg)\nGreen beanie Eric after a casual 30-km race. ALSO HAPPY VETERANS DAY!  \nThankfully, Arizona’s climate is warm and dry. Thankfully, Rob Krar and his\nwife, Christina, and my wonderful friend Wilson are all extremely welcoming. So\nno, I didn’t sleep in my car every single night, but close. I can’t wait have my\nown bed now. \n– First time I sent a fruit basket and realized that you can’t take the best\npeople in your life for granted. And a fruit basket is not, in fact, enough to\nprove that. \n– First environmental conferences I’ve been to since being out of college (two\nin one week, nonetheless): 1. Protect Our Winters\n    [https://protectourwinters.org/]  is an organization that pushes climate\n    change mitigation policy and pushes electing lawmakers who vote to protect\n    our climate. I’m really amped on POW’s elbow grease and ability to enact\n    needed change in this country.\n\nWe met in Salt Lake City for crash courses on climate change science, American\nvoting patterns, perceptions of climate change\n[http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/], and to talk shop with some of the\nhardest hitting snow-sports athletes in the world. I was one of two trail\nrunners there-Dakota Jones being the other-and was so inspired by the global\ncamaraderie to help America become a climate change mitigator and not a climate\nchange contributor.\n\nShoutout to two of my former professors, Michael Lemonick\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lemonick]  and Heidi Cullen\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Cullen], who taught one of my favorite\ncourses at Princeton, Communicating Climate Change. They taught me how to\nelucidate science in a digestible, relatable way and their work was rampant at\nPOW’s conference. Connecting people to science through emotion and storytelling\nis the best way to make change. Pro snowboarders, like POW founderJeremy Jones\n[https://www.outsideonline.com/1907681/shredding-toward-enlightenment], don’t\nneed to be climate scientists to enact change. Sharing stories of glacier\nretreat and low snowfall is more relatable than theKeeling Curve\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve]  will ever be. (Although, the\nKeeling Curve is still the foundation for everything).\n\n![Six-Americas-Nov-2016](/content/images/2017/11/six-americas-nov-2016.png)\nThere is no dispute about the  science behind climate change; the key is\nconvincing Americans that we should do something about it. We are winning this\nbattle, but need to convince more of the “cautious” and “concerned”\ndemographics.[2) Winter Wildlands Alliance](https://winterwildlands.org/) is an\norganization that protects human-powered winter recreation.

On the  Thursday before the race, Outside Magazine*** ***approached me about writing a piece about Cat Bradley’s Grand Canyon FKT. Without breathing, I said yes. So my race weekend was bookended with an interview with Cat and her pacers and then writing an article about Cat. Ultrarunning doesn’t get much more intimate than that.  \\n By Tuesday, when[ the article](https://www.outsideonline.com/2263656/cat-bradleys-obsessive-pursuit-grand-canyon) came out, I had forgotten that I’d raced just days earlier! Well, my body has reminded me of that every time I’ve tried to move. I’ve largely been immobile since the race. I feel close to the most wrecked I’ve ever felt; the only two comparable times are Western States and Leadville, but those were 100-mile races…  \\n Anyways, Thanksgiving happened with a wonderfully full extended family—40 Gallagher relatives in total—and I’m in Singapore now. Yes, as in [Singapore, the country i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore)n Southeast Asia. I’m en route to Thailand where I used to live and teach English and where [Earthraging](http://earthraging.org/) started. I’m going back to help with the third year of the swim program I started and couldn’t be more excited to get my feet wet in my old home.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1611\\\" style=\\\"width: 4608px\\\">![unnamed](/content/images/2017/11/unnamed.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">A bunch of family! PC: Abby Levene–what an effort!</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n## BUT BEFORE IT SLIPS MY MIND: TNF50. What a race!\\n\\nI think most of the field goes into TNF50 wondering if their legs had already maxed out this year. I sure did. I somewhat reluctantly signed up as soon as my health became close to >90% post-CCC—I’d been nursing a chronic knee injury—but my training was nowhere close to that percentage of maximum. Alas, I signed up because I love to race. And because I really wanted to run across the Golden Gate Bridge.  \\n Week of the race, I felt undertrained, as I didn’t have much time to gain much fitness since CCC. If anything, I was just trying to desperately hold on to any of my CCC and summer fitness. I briefly chronicled my training, and not ideal travel schedule, of the past months [here](https://claregallagherruns.wordpress.com/2017/11/13/life-firsts-fall-2017/).  \\n I knew I had fewer miles in me than say, Ida Nilsson (winner of the race), who openly shared her [110-mile training week](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbIQtHjFPvj/?hl=en&taken-by=idanilssi), at altitude in Flagstaff. I have so much respect for Ida because she goes so hard. “A running camp before the race this year was better than the ski camp I had last year.” She laughed in a post race [IRunFar interview](http://www.irunfar.com/2017/11/ida-nilsson-2017-the-north-face-50-mile-champion-interview.html). If she’s healthy and fit, Ida is a force. It was an honor and pleasure to race a tad closer to her this time around.  \\n Unlike Ida’s, my body operates pretty well off lower mileage. As long as I have speed, over 90% health, and a clear desire to race, I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.  \\n Last Saturday was no exception. I didn’t really even feel like I was racing until my alarm went off at 3:20am. Race was at 5am. My crewman, and boyfriend, Lenny, had arrived at 1am. No rest for the psyched!  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1609\\\" style=\\\"width: 2448px\\\">![IMG_3563](/content/images/2017/11/img_3563.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Teammate Steph and I fueled with respective bags of corn chips the night before the “race” that we both didn’t feel like we were even racing.</figcaption></figure>  \\n Once the race went off, I chatted with many guys, as I love to do in ultras, as it ensures that I’m not redlining from the gun and reminds me that I should be having fun. A highlight of my morning was running near [Megan Roche](http://www.espn.com/espnw/life-style/article/21505005/ultrarunner-megan-roche-fourth-year-medical-school-claiming-national-titles-sport). Now, I laud Ida, but I revere Megan Roche. I could never become the dedicated early bird and dual med school–trail overachiever that she is—trust me, I actually tried doing just that and failed before I even got started. Her openness about life, training and injuries makes her relatable to us mortals, and I take every morsel of Megan motivation I can get. I swear to god it helps. When I ever feel sorry for myself because I’m tired from travel or unprepared for a run, I think of Megan’s past three years and I shut my trap.  \\n It doesn’t hurt that her husband, [David](https://swaprunning.com/), coaches both of us, so I feel connected to her whether she knows it or not. I know we share a similar desire to race our brains out. This is all to say that, Megan, it was such a pleasure to share the sunrise in your company last Saturday and to talk shop in those early miles. We crushed ourselves, but also crushed that race.  \\n Back to the race: Megan and I had no to desire to keep up with Ida, Renee Metivier and Anne-Lise Rousset. We held a comfortable pace till our first crew stop at mile 13.3, Tennessee Valley. Just like last year, and every time this race happens, aid stations for the front runners are NSCAR pit stops. Megan Kimmel caught up to us, looking quite comfortable, around mile 14. We chatted a bit, then strung out after a steep descent, which I decided to hammer. I never looked back. Well, only two miles later I started to feel like crap: mile 16 of a 50-mile race. Not an ideal place to start feeling like compost. I looked back and saw that Kimmel was keeping the same distance behind me. Jason Koop was running in the opposite direction and said I was 90 seconds off the leaders. Oh and by this time, both Megans and I had passed Anne-Lise. So it was just Ida and Renee ahead. It wasn’t even mile 20 and this race already felt like a battle.  \\n While feeling sorry for myself, wondering if I’d gone out too hard or if my lack of long runs since CCC was already hitting me in the face, a guy caught up behind me. He recognized me and said “I’m going to hop on the Clare pain train!”  \\n I thought this was hilarious and not annoying in the least bit. Sometimes, the men who are the same pace of lead women have abrasive ‘man’ complexes that can result in comments that don’t land quite right. I’m talking about guys who think they’re top runner guys, but then are forced to come to terms with the fact that they are actually the speed of top women. If you’re one of these guys, embrace it. You’re not slow. You’re still likely in the top 10% of the field. I just recommend that you cool it on the machismo and try to have fun with us speedy ladies. I encourage you to be like Dmitri!  \\n Dimitri, the pain train man, ran behind me all the way down to Stinson Beach—for over 10 miles. We shared a few words about our year of racing and I learned he’s Russian, but lived in San Diego for the past two decades. For the most part though, we just pretended we were on an actual train. “Choo Choo!” I yelled, “No one’s getting off this pain train. Settle in!” We both committed to the push and push we did.  \\n “All aboard!” was my favorite phrase I yelled as we careened down the sharp switchbacks to Stinson. We were both grimacing at the quad-destroying descent, but also laughing at our ridiculous train scenario. I’d note the fallen trees and we’d both yell “Fuck fuck!” We were on the same page and it was so much fun. We both were working our wheels off, but simultaneously enjoying the moist, fecund forest.  \\n “It’s so green!” I’d yell.  \\n “Yes, it is!” Dimitri would kindly respond.  \\n I never saw him after Stinson Beach, because like I mentioned, my aid stops were fast. Lenny would calmly hand me seven gels, two soft flasks, one with water one with Coke, I’d yell something stupid out of excitement—specifically at Seth Swanson at Stinson because *he *was yelling and was so excited—and then be on my merry way, hunting down the next unassuming men who would board the Clare pain train.  \\n I passed Renee at around 30. She was still smiling and clearly will have a future in ultras if she just keeps smiling.  \\n I never caught Ida. I came as close as a minute, but a Porta Pottie stop at mile 39.5 increased her lead to 4 minutes and it stayed that way for the rest of the race.  \\n A late race highlight was catching up to [Moises Jimenez](https://www.chileclimbers.cl/2017/09/14/moises-jimenez-entrega-cinco-razones-comenzar-practicar-trail-running/). A TNF runner from Chile, Moises and I have shared some of the most intimate of race moments together. With less than 8 miles to go in CCC this past September, I was racing out of my mind, speed hiking uphill, when I caught Moises. It was clear we both wanted to die. His kind eyes and heart-throbbing smile kept me going. He also can yell really loud. “C’mon CLARE!”  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1605\\\" style=\\\"width: 2048px\\\">![IMG_3593](/content/images/2017/11/img_3593.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Teammates Zach, Moises and Paddy. PC: Byron Powell.</figcaption></figure>  \\n This exact same thing happened at TNF on our way down to the Golden Gate Bridge. Except Moises really kept me moving this time, yelling, “C’mon! LET’S GO!” down the steep switchbacks, practically on top of the bridge.  \\n We hit the bridge and my road legs took over.  \\n On the bridge, which is arguably the highlight of my race, I had some surreal dark thoughts. I thought about the book I happened to be reading at the time: *[The Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road)* by Cormac McCarthy. I thought, hey, running this right now is a heck of a lot better than trying to survive a post-apocalyptic world. I thought of the [Rohingya of Myanmar](http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/25/these-are-the-scars-and-burns-of-the-rohingya-refugees%E2%80%A8-fleeing-myanmar-7102484/). How they are being persecuted, murdered, in a form of ethnic cleansing by the Buddhist majority Burmese people. Lastly, I thought about my brother Eric, as I always do in races. How he, who is the most liberal dude you’ll ever meet, happens to be serving his country. How Eric never complains.My “pain train” became very small and embarrassing when I compared it to the real world.  \\n Anyways, ‘twas a fun, meaningful race and I’m so grateful to all involved and who sent me support from near and far. Enjoy the changing of seasons. If you’re wondering what I’m up to, the most likely bet is I’m eating my weight in Pad Thai. Cheers.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1606\\\" style=\\\"width: 1024px\\\">![IMG_3590](/content/images/2017/11/img_3590.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Princeton Tigers running ultras!

And because I really wanted to run across the Golden Gate Bridge.<br>\nWeek of the race, I felt undertrained, as I didn’t have much time to gain much fitness since CCC. If anything, I was just trying to desperately hold on to any of my CCC and summer fitness. I briefly chronicled my training, and not ideal travel schedule, of the past months <a href=\"https://claregallagherruns.wordpress.com/2017/11/13/life-firsts-fall-2017/\">here</a>.<br>\nI knew I had fewer miles in me than say, Ida Nilsson (winner of the race), who openly shared her <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BbIQtHjFPvj/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=idanilssi\">110-mile training week</a>, at altitude in Flagstaff. I have so much respect for Ida because she goes so hard. “A running camp before the race this year was better than the ski camp I had last year.” She laughed in a post race <a href=\"http://www.irunfar.com/2017/11/ida-nilsson-2017-the-north-face-50-mile-champion-interview.html\">IRunFar interview</a>. If she’s healthy and fit, Ida is a force. It was an honor and pleasure to race a tad closer to her this time around.<br>\nUnlike Ida’s, my body operates pretty well off lower mileage. As long as I have speed, over 90% health, and a clear desire to race, I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.<br>\nLast Saturday was no exception. I didn’t really even feel like I was racing until my alarm went off at 3:20am. Race was at 5am. My crewman, and boyfriend, Lenny, had arrived at 1am. No rest for the psyched!</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1609\" style=\"width: 2448px\">![IMG_3563](/content/images/2017/11/img_3563.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teammate Steph and I fueled with respective bags of corn chips the night before the “race” that we both didn’t feel like we were even racing.</figcaption></figure>  \n Once the race went off, I chatted with many guys, as I love to do in ultras, as it ensures that I’m not redlining from the gun and reminds me that I should be having fun. A highlight of my morning was running near [Megan Roche](http://www.espn.com/espnw/life-style/article/21505005/ultrarunner-megan-roche-fourth-year-medical-school-claiming-national-titles-sport). Now, I laud Ida, but I revere Megan Roche. I could never become the dedicated early bird and dual med school–trail overachiever that she is—trust me, I actually tried doing just that and failed before I even got started. Her openness about life, training and injuries makes her relatable to us mortals, and I take every morsel of Megan motivation I can get. I swear to god it helps. When I ever feel sorry for myself because I’m tired from travel or unprepared for a run, I think of Megan’s past three years and I shut my trap.  \n It doesn’t hurt that her husband, [David](https://swaprunning.com/), coaches both of us, so I feel connected to her whether she knows it or not. I know we share a similar desire to race our brains out. This is all to say that, Megan, it was such a pleasure to share the sunrise in your company last Saturday and to talk shop in those early miles. We crushed ourselves, but also crushed that race.  \n Back to the race: Megan and I had no to desire to keep up with Ida, Renee Metivier and Anne-Lise Rousset. We held a comfortable pace till our first crew stop at mile 13.3, Tennessee Valley. Just like last year, and every time this race happens, aid stations for the front runners are NSCAR pit stops. Megan Kimmel caught up to us, looking quite comfortable, around mile 14. We chatted a bit, then strung out after a steep descent, which I decided to hammer. I never looked back. Well, only two miles later I started to feel like crap: mile 16 of a 50-mile race. Not an ideal place to start feeling like compost. I looked back and saw that Kimmel was keeping the same distance behind me. Jason Koop was running in the opposite direction and said I was 90 seconds off the leaders. Oh and by this time, both Megans and I had passed Anne-Lise. So it was just Ida and Renee ahead. It wasn’t even mile 20 and this race already felt like a battle.  \n While feeling sorry for myself, wondering if I’d gone out too hard or if my lack of long runs since CCC was already hitting me in the face, a guy caught up behind me. He recognized me and said “I’m going to hop on the Clare pain train!”  \n I thought this was hilarious and not annoying in the least bit. Sometimes, the men who are the same pace of lead women have abrasive ‘man’ complexes that can result in comments that don’t land quite right. I’m talking about guys who think they’re top runner guys, but then are forced to come to terms with the fact that they are actually the speed of top women. If you’re one of these guys, embrace it. You’re not slow. You’re still likely in the top 10% of the field. I just recommend that you cool it on the machismo and try to have fun with us speedy ladies. I encourage you to be like Dmitri!  \n Dimitri, the pain train man, ran behind me all the way down to Stinson Beach—for over 10 miles. We shared a few words about our year of racing and I learned he’s Russian, but lived in San Diego for the past two decades. For the most part though, we just pretended we were on an actual train. “Choo Choo!” I yelled, “No one’s getting off this pain train. Settle in!” We both committed to the push and push we did.  \n “All aboard!” was my favorite phrase I yelled as we careened down the sharp switchbacks to Stinson. We were both grimacing at the quad-destroying descent, but also laughing at our ridiculous train scenario. I’d note the fallen trees and we’d both yell “Fuck fuck!” We were on the same page and it was so much fun. We both were working our wheels off, but simultaneously enjoying the moist, fecund forest.  \n “It’s so green!” I’d yell.  \n “Yes, it is!” Dimitri would kindly respond.  \n I never saw him after Stinson Beach, because like I mentioned, my aid stops were fast. Lenny would calmly hand me seven gels, two soft flasks, one with water one with Coke, I’d yell something stupid out of excitement—specifically at Seth Swanson at Stinson because *he *was yelling and was so excited—and then be on my merry way, hunting down the next unassuming men who would board the Clare pain train.  \n I passed Renee at around 30. She was still smiling and clearly will have a future in ultras if she just keeps smiling.  \n I never caught Ida. I came as close as a minute, but a Porta Pottie stop at mile 39.5 increased her lead to 4 minutes and it stayed that way for the rest of the race.  \n A late race highlight was catching up to [Moises Jimenez](https://www.chileclimbers.cl/2017/09/14/moises-jimenez-entrega-cinco-razones-comenzar-practicar-trail-running/). A TNF runner from Chile, Moises and I have shared some of the most intimate of race moments together. With less than 8 miles to go in CCC this past September, I was racing out of my mind, speed hiking uphill, when I caught Moises. It was clear we both wanted to die. His kind eyes and heart-throbbing smile kept me going. He also can yell really loud. “C’mon CLARE!”  \n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1605\" style=\"width: 2048px\">![IMG_3593](/content/images/2017/11/img_3593.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Teammates Zach, Moises and Paddy. PC: Byron Powell.</figcaption></figure>  \n This exact same thing happened at TNF on our way down to the Golden Gate Bridge. Except Moises really kept me moving this time, yelling, “C’mon! LET’S GO!” down the steep switchbacks, practically on top of the bridge.  \n We hit the bridge and my road legs took over.  \n On the bridge, which is arguably the highlight of my race, I had some surreal dark thoughts. I thought about the book I happened to be reading at the time: *[The Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road)* by Cormac McCarthy. I thought, hey, running this right now is a heck of a lot better than trying to survive a post-apocalyptic world. I thought of the [Rohingya of Myanmar](http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/25/these-are-the-scars-and-burns-of-the-rohingya-refugees%E2%80%A8-fleeing-myanmar-7102484/). How they are being persecuted, murdered, in a form of ethnic cleansing by the Buddhist majority Burmese people. Lastly, I thought about my brother Eric, as I always do in races. How he, who is the most liberal dude you’ll ever meet, happens to be serving his country. How Eric never complains.My “pain train” became very small and embarrassing when I compared it to the real world.  \n Anyways, ‘twas a fun, meaningful race and I’m so grateful to all involved and who sent me support from near and far. Enjoy the changing of seasons. If you’re wondering what I’m up to, the most likely bet is I’m eating my weight in Pad Thai. Cheers.  \n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" id=\"attachment_1606\" style=\"width: 1024px\">![IMG_3590](/content/images/2017/11/img_3590.jpg)<figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Princeton Tigers running ultras!

Thanks to many article recommendations and ideas—[this one](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/16/carbon-offset-projects-carbon-emissions) being the most informative—I’ve learned that carbon offsets, which are increasingly synonymous with RECs (Renewable Energy Credits), are way more complicated than “1) Buy me and 2) Poof! Away goes that flight from Denver to SF.”\\n\\n### Carbon offsets are complicated\\n\\nIn order to be effective, a carbon offset—money spent on a project used to offset carbon emissions—needs to go towards a project that is permanent, verifiable, AND additional. To see how these attributes work, let’s take a classic carbon offset program: paying an owner of primary forest to not chop down the forest. This sounds great. But, is such a project guaranteed to last forever? Will a logging company pay the forest owner more money in 50 years to then chop down the trees? Will an oil palm plantation pay the forest owners in 100 years to purchase the land for palm oil tree cultivation?  \\n If the answer is always, ‘no,’ then the project is permanent. *But*, how do we *verify *this? How do we prove the forest is still there? That’s expensive, especially considering the most important types of forests to save are remote tropical rainforests. Do our offsets hire a full-time monitor of the land? Subsequently, do our offsets collaborate agreeably with the local stakeholders? Or are they imposing false ownership and interfere with local governments? These questions are myriad and there are rarely simple answers.  \\n Lastly, is the project additional? Are our offsets saving forest from deforestation that would’ve not already been protected by local stakeholders, another organization or a government? This goes back to the verifiable issue. How do we know that our offsets are worth *anything substantial? *My conclusion: the efficacy of offsets is incredibly difficult to prove. That isn’t to say they aren’t potentially great ([here’s a list](https://www.green-e.org/programs/climate/endorsed-programs) of widely recommended programs). But, for now, I think my money is better spent in a more local, political realm. Yep, *political. *Hear me out.\\n\\n### An Alternative to Questionably Effective Carbon Offsets\\n\\nAuden Schendler, VP of sustainability at Aspen Skiing Company and a board member of [Protect Our Winters (POW),](https://protectourwinters.org/) argues that purchasing offsets or RECs is not as useful as [donating to a political campaign](https://thinkprogress.org/clean-energy-trainwreck-why-most-recs-are-bad-and-how-to-find-the-good-ones-63975573c073/) that will help elect a pro-climate change mitigation candidate. We need institutionalized change. Individual actions are great, and shouldn’t be discounted, but personally, I agree with Auden. A government that works towards climate change mitigation is more powerful than a questionably effective rainforest protection project.  \\n I’m going to donate money to pro-climate change candidates in Colorado’s 2018 gubernatorial election. I’m going to follow the advocacy work of POW like it’s my job. In many senses, it *is* my job to follow the political atmosphere, individual elections, and spread difficult-to-obtain knowledge about who’s pro-what.\\n\\n### Bigger Picture: Institutionalized Change\\n\\nThe past few years have left a lot of us head-scratching. I wonder if we participated in democracy more, i.e. if all of our carbon offset purchases and all of REC purchases were geared towards pro-climate change mitigation political candidates in the U.S., would we have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement?  \\n Would there have been more voter participation in the 2016 Presidential Election? Would the extremely knowledgeable Latino demographic have favored Clinton more, similar to how they voted for Obama in 2012? [Latinos are the most concerned demographic about climate change in the U.S.](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-latino-mind-may-2017/)  \\n So, why were [Latino votes lower for Clinton](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/29/hillary-clinton-wins-latino-vote-but-falls-below-2012-support-for-obama/) than they were for Obama four years prior? Every year we only know more and more about climate change. Would targeted climate change political campaigning have increased the votes for Clinton? I understand these are broad and simple questions to very complex and nuanced situations, but I think that my money could’ve helped in hindsight.  \\n So for now, I’ll donate 10% of my 2017 income to a pro-climate change mitigation candidate in Colorado’s 2018 elections.

Oregon Monument: **Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument\\n\\nAnother one of the National Monuments under threat of being shrunk: this biological paradise in Eastern Oregon is a prized area for the state.

Set a time and a place to do activity together.\n\n\nResult: You will be more stoked on life after completing the activity.\nHistory: this is known as ‘playing’ or ‘getting exercise’ or ‘getting some fresh\nair’ or ‘girl time’ or ‘dude time’ or ‘friend time’ OR even for those who\nself-identify as extremely reclusive or hermitlike you can take this medication\nwithout a buddy. You do you. Just get the heck outside.\nHere are some very professional photographs of the medication at work in my own\nlife in just the past week. My buddy’s name: Abby. It’s just wild how well\nshe/it works!\n\n![](/content/images/2018/02/img_3380-150x150.jpg)\n![](/content/images/2018/02/img_3501-150x150.jpg)\n![](/content/images/2018/02/img_1225-150x150.jpg)",

I need a long off-season. I will execute a long off-season.\\n\\nThis was my mentality three months ago after The North Face 50-mile Championships in California. And guess what? I executed a long off-season. The point of this recap of my past three months is to let you know that **it can be very fruitful to be seemingly unfruitful.**  \\n I started my off-season with hardly walking. My legs were wrecked that badly after TNF50. Not in an acute injury sense, but in a race-above-your-fitness type of sense. My muscles were wrung dry of any flexibility. My joints were pounded into oblivion (in reality, oblivion lasted two weeks). Most notably, my mind was exhausted. I’d been racing since February, when I got second at the Black Canyon 100k, in order to run Western States last year. Side note: I’m not even trying to qualify for States this year. I want to race more courses, especially mountain courses. Rest assured, I’ll return to States eventually, just not right now when I have a different appetite.  \\n Just five days after TNF50, I visited my old stomping grounds of Southern Thailand just north of Phuket. With a buddy, we checked in on the youth swim program we started there three years ago. I ran a little, but only towards the end of my trip.  \\n After returning home from Asia, I was running a bit, more or less whenever I felt like it. My coach, [David Roche](https://swaprunning.com/), does such a good job of letting the reigns relax during times where there’s no pressing race goal. Heck, I guess he does this all of the time for me, but still, an off-season is meant to feel like you’re reporting to no one but yourself.  \\n I’ve skied a little this winter, but the pathetic Colorado snowpack has made it a lot less incentivizing to get up at 4am to ski for a few hours around sunrise—as is the typical ‘skimo’ session with my close Boulder friends. Still, I was focused on staying healthy and rested, and won an uphill ski race in Vail two weeks ago. I tasted blood and pushed hard for the first time in months. It was awesome.  \\n To add to my off-season: I’ve been atypically cold. What? I know, I should just put a jacket on. But something about this winter, or maybe my forced off-season has turned me into a hibernating baby when it comes to sub 20F temps. I sometimes have a hard time motivating myself to get out when it’s cold. It’s super lame and I’m embarrassed to admit it, but I’ve concluded that it’s okay to take it easy! I’m not trying to race in sub-freezing temps, nor do I care what people think of my less-than-impressive training consistency this past winter. I prioritized feel and motivation over everything, and have some 30-mile weeks to show for it. Whoa, dream big!  \\n Seriously, I’m writing it here in the chance anyone reading this has felt similarly during any season and felt lame for not having the A+ stoke and motivation to crush 24/7 regardless of weather or temperature. Listen up: it’s okay. You can crush. *Crush your off-season.*\\n\\n### Fruits of Perceived Lethargy\\n\\nSo, after three months of [low mileage](https://www.strava.com/pros/16362182), a little skiing and biking and climbing, and extra caution with tiny injuries that popped up as I started to incorporate speed work into my running in the last month, I feel the following:  \\n 1) Very rested, both mentally and physically.  \\n 2) So, so, so excited for summer  \\n 3) HEALTHY: with bimonthly bodywork and acupuncture at the first sign of a little something, even babying chronic hamstring problems, loosening a tight back, poking an Achilles or ITB back into submission…you name it. I’m not immune to injuries, quite the opposite. I’ve just come to learn that the only way to stay in the game is to be proactive and be willing to pay $$ for preventative treatment if you’re willing to pay $$ for a race goal. They go hand-in-hand, and I practice this even in my off-season, when the cold and different activities like gym climbing and skiing are likely to aggravate something.\\n\\n### Beginning to Truly Run Again\\n\\nI raced a half marathon in Pueblo last weekend, almost exactly three months after TNF50 and it went well! I raced smooth, just sneaking in under 1:20, and I’m living to tell the tail after placing second.  \\n My year of trail running is just barely beginning and I am so excited.  \\n Up next on the blog: about life transition to being a Patagonia Ambassador.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1648\\\" style=\\\"width: 4608px\\\">![IMG_3630](/content/images/2018/02/img_3630.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Four days after TNF, I a was a spectator at the Denver Mile High Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving.

I’ve just come to learn that the\n    only way to stay in the game is to be proactive and be willing to pay $$ for\n    preventative treatment if you’re willing to pay $$ for a race goal. They go\n    hand-in-hand, and I practice this even in my off-season, when the cold and\n    different activities like gym climbing and skiing are likely to aggravate\n    something.\n\nBeginning to Truly Run Again\nI raced a half marathon in Pueblo last weekend, almost exactly three months\nafter TNF50 and it went well! I raced smooth, just sneaking in under 1:20, and\nI’m living to tell the tail after placing second.\nMy year of trail running is just barely beginning and I am so excited.\nUp next on the blog: about life transition to being a Patagonia Ambassador.\n\n![IMG_3630](/content/images/2018/02/img_3630.jpg)\nFour days after TNF, I a was a spectator at the Denver Mile High Turkey Trot on\nThanksgiving. In case you’re wondering: Eric won this year’s TT yet again for\nthe Gallagher family and my Mom beat my Dad yet again.\n![IMG_3647](/content/images/2018/02/img_3647.jpg)\nThe tsunami evacuation tower where I’d do repeats in 2014 when I trained for my\nfirst ultra! I lived just a mile away from here and the school I taught at was\n“across the street” inland.\n![IMG_0009](/content/images/2018/02/img_0009.jpg)\nOkay, so I have skied a few times before sunrise this winter.\n![IMG_1727](/content/images/2018/02/img_1727.jpg)\nMost of my runs have been with friends who motivate me to get out. Abby and\nMartina here.\n![IMG_0116](/content/images/2018/02/img_0116.jpg)\nMartina, the Italian skier goddess!\n![IMG_0381](/content/images/2018/02/img_0381.jpg)\nLots of family time over training time!\n![IMG_0480](/content/images/2018/02/img_0480.jpg)\nAnd a 250-mile bike tour with the homies in New Mexico. Joshy, Tony, and Lenny.\n![IMG_0640](/content/images/2018/02/img_0640.jpg)\nRunning towards Brendan because I think he has a cookie.\n![IMG_0877](/content/images/2018/02/img_0877.jpg)\nI’ve been climbing in the gym quite a bit. Sending a V2 boulder project is my\nmain 2018 goal. I’m not kidding.\n![IMG_0888](/content/images/2018/02/img_0888.jpg)\nI’ve run on cement quite a bit. It’s efficient.\n![IMG_0808](/content/images/2018/02/img_0808.jpg)\nI ran 3×6 mile segments in a 250-mile relay from Bears Ears to Grand Staircase\nEscalante. This is waking up one morning in the spectacular Grand Staircase\nEscalante National Monument.\n![IMG_1032](/content/images/2018/02/img_1032.jpg)\nSkiing with homegirl and new Patagonia teammate Caroline!\n![IMG_1073](/content/images/2018/02/img_1073.jpg)\nRunning 15 miles with Stack Attack for his Boulder 15 summits. I met him at 4am\non the top of the First flatiron and we ran to Sanitas to finish his epic\n24-hour effort.\n![creek7](/content/images/2018/02/creek7.jpg)\nI’ve talked about running. And about climate change. And about scuba diving.\nHere I’m doing a Protect Our Winters presentation at my high school, Cherry\nCreek.\n![IMG_1126](/content/images/2018/02/img_1126.jpg)\nThe longest run I’ve done since TNF50 was a 22 mile slog-fest with the two\nAbbys.\n![IMG_1265](/content/images/2018/02/img_1265.jpg)\nAfter the Vail uphill ski race!

It was really hard to ‘leave’ the incredible team of athletes that make up the The North Face; some of whom are mentors and best friends. But my decision wasn’t about athletes or teams. It was about the connection between consumerism, products and environmentalism. In short, Patagonia epitomizes what I think this world needs, and frankly, what I need: **a constant push to take better care of our planet and of each other. **  \\n After I won Leadville in 2016, I actually reached out to Patagonia. They were my dream company to represent. Unsurprisingly, Patagonia doesn’t pick up runners merely after winning races. Of course they have world-class athletes for ambassadors, but they are not called athletes. Instead, a Patagonia ‘Ambassador’ is treated as a conduit of the company’s conservation ethos, not just a fast mountain runner, amazing surfer, baller skier, or skilled climber, etc.\\n\\n### **OBSESSED MUCH? **\\n\\nLong before I was trail running, I was fretting about the Earth’s fate. Coincidentally, or not, I read ‘**[Let My People Go Surfing](http://www.patagonia.com/product/let-my-people-go-surfing-revised-paperback-book/BK067.html?dwvar_BK067_color=000&cgid=books-stories#tile-3=&start=1&sz=24)’** in middle school. In high school, I ran our recycling club and in college, a fossil fuel Divestment campaign. I started breathing [environmental ethics](http://ulrich-menzel.de/forschungsberichte/water-and-international-relations-presentation_karafyllis) after studying the utilitarianism ethics of **[Peter Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer)**. It’s undeniable that we have a duty to make this world a better place. And currently, we really suck at it.  \\n My dreams before trail running were to go medical school in order to work in developing countries in family planning, or to continue to research coral ecology. Even though I got to SCUBA dive for hours a day, months on end while researching a niche field of coral ecology—crevice theory, which basically tests whether more complex reef structures will promote more resilient reefs after a disturbance like an intense typhoon or bad bleaching episode—it was just so depressing! The oceans are our lifelines, regardless if we never see one in our entire lives, and I hated thinking about our dying blue planet every moment of every day. I wasn’t cut out for research. Or med school for that matter.  \\n Fast forward to 2017, after Leadville, when I found myself running a lot, traveling a lot and talking a lot about running a lot. I was constantly hustling to make ends meet with sponsorships, but honestly, not feeling like I was doing that much for the world by being a marketing asset for a large corporate brand. It wasn’t enough. Running will never be enough. The ability to run for leisure, let alone a job, is a privilege. I have to do more.  \\n One beautiful thing about trail running is that I can connect it to the ever-pressing question: How can I hurt the Earth less?  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_media-19\\\" style=\\\"width: 3648px\\\">![IMG_4776.JPG](/content/images/2018/04/img_4776.jpg)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">Trying to talk less and think more. PC: Mike Thurk</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n### **WALKING THE TALK: GOOD PRODUCTS **\\n\\nAs a trail runner, I am a marketing asset for a clothing brand. When the opportunity to represent Patagonia arose at the end of 2017, I literally cried in relief. I can better walk my own talk by representing a brand I stand fully behind. A brand that explains where and how its products are made. A brand not afraid to forgo profit for environmental health. A brand not afraid to stand up to people and lobbyists who will do anything to prevent renewable energy freedom. Sure, Patagonia and The North Face are incomparable in so many ways and both great in so many ways. One’s still privately owned and the other is publicly traded. That doesn’t make the latter intrinsically bad, but my best fit was clear.  \\n If I’m going to share facts and spread awareness about climatic and environmental and political facts, I need to hold myself to the highest of standards, and with Patagonia—which is like a photovoltaic cell in a world of oil rigs—I can finally do that.\\n\\n### **THE PRODUCTS**\\n\\nSo what about the clothes? Before joining Patagonia, I admit, I had no clue what organic cotton was. Well, I was blown-away and straight up embarrassed that I didn’t know what I was wearing before. It’s my job! Shouldn’t I know about the products more than ‘they feel good and look good?’ Let’s take cotton: organic cotton is truly the only option for a concerned consumer today who can afford to care about what brands she is buying.\\n\\n### **ABOUT ORGANIC COTTON**\\n\\nCompared to conventional cotton, [ORGANIC COTTON](http://www.patagonia.com/organic-cotton.html) is infinitely better for our environment, from topsoil biodiversity, water usage, and health for farmers and all people who come into contact with the cotton.  \\n Conventionally grown cotton uses extensive amounts of synthetic fertilizers, soil additives, defoliants and other substances that wreak havoc on soil, water, air and living things, from local ecosystems to humans that work on cotton farms. Basically, you can wear a shirt that’s half synthetic chemical that uses a ton more water, or you can wear a shirt that is pure cotton, promotes soil biodiversity (important insects and plants) and is safer for farmers. Oh, and it uses way less water.  \\n Again, organic cotton uses no fertilizers and way less water, but it’s more expensive and time-consuming to produce. So you have to make a choice that’ll cost you $5 more.

The best thing you can do is not buy anything. Keep your stuff! Keep your many different brands!  \\n But, alas, we’re only human and we need to buy things sometimes. So when you do buy a t-shirt, if you’ve made it this far in my blog, you have the capacity to purchase one that’s made of organic cotton. I encourage you to do so. And to be super freaking proud of it. Conscious consumerism is cool. It’s empowering. It’s making you an environmentalist, a pragmatist and part of the solution with one simple action.  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1674\\\" style=\\\"width: 1351px\\\">![Screen Shot 2018-04-03 at 10.39.27.png](/content/images/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-03-at-10-39-27.png)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">[MATERIALS ](http://www.patagonia.com/materials-tech.html)</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n### **DOWN JACKETS ‘N OTHER GOOD STUFF**\\n\\nPatagonia *created* the [Traceable Down Standard](http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/collaboration/sustainable_brands/new_global_traceable_down_standard_addresses_animal_): which ensures no birds, like geese, were force–fed or live–plucked, and prohibits the use of blended down, which is often untraceable.  \\n<iframe allow=\\\"autoplay; encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"295\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQlU1_Mam4M?feature=oembed\\\" width=\\\"525\\\"></iframe>  \\n Additionally, Patagonia helped develop the [Responsible Wool Standard](http://www.patagonia.com/blog/2016/07/our-wool-restart/), which ensures that sheep are treated with respect to their Five Freedoms and also ensures the best land management and land protection practices.

I have to do more.\nOne beautiful thing about trail running is that I can connect it to the\never-pressing question: How can I hurt the Earth less?\n\n![IMG_4776.JPG](/content/images/2018/04/img_4776.jpg)\nTrying to talk less and think more. PC: Mike Thurk**WALKING THE TALK: GOOD\nPRODUCTS **\nAs a trail runner, I am a marketing asset for a clothing brand. When the\nopportunity to represent Patagonia arose at the end of 2017, I literally cried\nin relief. I can better walk my own talk by representing a brand I stand fully\nbehind. A brand that explains where and how its products are made. A brand not\nafraid to forgo profit for environmental health. A brand not afraid to stand up\nto people and lobbyists who will do anything to prevent renewable energy\nfreedom. Sure, Patagonia and The North Face are incomparable in so many ways and\nboth great in so many ways. One’s still privately owned and the other is\npublicly traded. That doesn’t make the latter intrinsically bad, but my best fit\nwas clear.\nIf I’m going to share facts and spread awareness about climatic and\nenvironmental and political facts, I need to hold myself to the highest of\nstandards, and with Patagonia—which is like a photovoltaic cell in a world of\noil rigs—I can finally do that.\n\nTHE PRODUCTS\nSo what about the clothes? Before joining Patagonia, I admit, I had no clue what\norganic cotton was. Well, I was blown-away and straight up embarrassed that I\ndidn’t know what I was wearing before. It’s my job! Shouldn’t I know about the\nproducts more than ‘they feel good and look good?’ Let’s take cotton: organic\ncotton is truly the only option for a concerned consumer today who can afford to\ncare about what brands she is buying.\n\nABOUT ORGANIC COTTON\nCompared to conventional cotton, ORGANIC COTTON\n[http://www.patagonia.com/organic-cotton.html]  is infinitely better for our\nenvironment, from topsoil biodiversity, water usage, and health for farmers and\nall people who come into contact with the cotton.\nConventionally grown cotton uses extensive amounts of synthetic fertilizers,\nsoil additives, defoliants and other substances that wreak havoc on soil, water,\nair and living things, from local ecosystems to humans that work on cotton\nfarms. Basically, you can wear a shirt that’s half synthetic chemical that uses\na ton more water, or you can wear a shirt that is pure cotton, promotes soil\nbiodiversity (important insects and plants) and is safer for farmers. Oh, and it\nuses way less water.\nAgain, organic cotton uses no fertilizers and way less water, but it’s more\nexpensive and time-consuming to produce. So you have to make a choice that’ll\ncost you $5 more.

The best thing you can do\nis not buy anything. Keep your stuff! Keep your many different brands!\nBut, alas, we’re only human and we need to buy things sometimes. So when you do\nbuy a t-shirt, if you’ve made it this far in my blog, you have the capacity to\npurchase one that’s made of organic cotton. I encourage you to do so. And to be\nsuper freaking proud of it. Conscious consumerism is cool. It’s empowering. It’s\nmaking you an environmentalist, a pragmatist and part of the solution with one\nsimple action.\n\n![Screen Shot 2018-04-03 at\n10.39.27.png](/content/images/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-03-at-10-39-27.png)\n[MATERIALS ](http://www.patagonia.com/materials-tech.html)DOWN JACKETS ‘N OTHER\nGOOD STUFF\nPatagoniacreated  the Traceable Down Standard\n[http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/collaboration/sustainable_brands/new_global_traceable_down_standard_addresses_animal_]\n: which ensures no birds, like geese, were force–fed or live–plucked, and\nprohibits the use of blended down, which is often untraceable.\n\nAdditionally, Patagonia helped develop the [Responsible Wool\nStandard](http://www.patagonia.com/blog/2016/07/our-wool-restart/), which\nensures that sheep are treated with respect to their Five Freedoms and also\nensures the best land management and land protection practices. Raising sheep\ncan be incredibly damaging to land. The RWS ensures it’s not. Wool from\ncertified farms is IDed thoroughly and tracked all the way to end product. Read\nabout this in depth\n[here](http://www.patagonia.com/static/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-PatagoniaShared/default/dw9294a7c0/slots/RMA/PAT_2016_Wool_Standard_r5.pdf).\n\nI could go on and on about the many [standards\nPatagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/environmental-impact.html) uses when\ncreating their products, and I will. For now, just think about how each product\nwe buy and wear has a footprint. What do your footprints look like? \nThe smaller the footprint, the better the [horrific garment\nindustry](http://riverbluethemovie.eco/) becomes and the bars are raised higher\nwhen more consumers are buying thoughtfully made products. \nCheers to transitions. And making uncomfortable decisions when the status quo is\njust fine. Challenging ourselves to be better can, in fact, make us better, eh?\n\nP.S. Not to forget, FAIR TRADE:",

And as a professional trail runner, I feel it’s my duty to know the issues surrounding the trails I run. Back home in the U.S., we’re seeing dismantling of protections around public lands and it’s scary. I never imagined it could be similar in picture perfect Cinque Terre, but I’d soon found out…  \\n**The Trails *Are* Incredibly Beautiful**  \\n I arrived a week prior to this year’s 50k race, giving me time to get a sense for the region. Thankfully, SciaccheTrail occurs right before the busy tourist season—which begins on Easter weekend and goes till early November—so I could maneuver through the villages to the trailheads without too many large tour groups blocking the way.  \\n My first expectation of Cinque Terre was correct: the place is so gorgeous it’s borderline magical. The steep, relentless hills that jut out from the Mediterranean Sea boast trails that are every runner’s dream.  \\n[The 120 kilometer long trail network](http://mappe.parconazionale5terre.it/plus/map2/map.html#13%7C44.1160%7C9.7277) is surprisingly rugged and varied. The relatively flat coastal (SVA) trails showcase jaw-dropping views of crystal blue sea. They are narrow, and sometimes even harrowing. First created by farmers, dating back to the 11<sup>th</sup> century AD, these trails connect vineyards, showcasing the rich cultivation history. Unfortunately, tour groups often dominate the SVA paths, which I will touch on later. Crowded, narrow paths are not safe for anyone involved.  \\n The heart of the Park lies in the rolling single-track that’s engulfed in forests and hovers along ridgelines above the villages. These trails are numbered in the 500s, or labeled with AV5T. While running along these higher trails, you’ll earn glimpses of the bright sea in tiny forest openings, but will rarely see a village, and it’s almost guaranteed you won’t encounter a tour group. These trails feel remote!  \\n Oh, and we cannot forget: the stairs. The stairs ascending out of each of five villages are brutally steep and devilishly fun. I usually dislike power-hiking up stairs, but after racing SciaccheTrail, I have a deep respect and even a little love for them. You feel intrinsically connected to the villages because you remember that the farmers, mainly women, have been hauling 25-kg harvests on their heads up these stairs for centuries.  \\n Today, as farming has become less lucrative and large tour groups assault the villages in droves, I realized that Cinque Terre needs runners and hikers more than ever before.  \\n**What’s the Problem?**  \\n Cruise ships drop thousands of people per day to snap selfies of the colored homes—which unbeknownst to the tourists, were first painted just in the 1970s—and then the day-trippers leave. Most tourists never step foot on one trail, let alone buy lunch or the famous local dessert wine, Sciacchetra, or stay in a hotel or B&B.  \\n If tourists do get to a trail, it’s almost certainly a coastal (SVA) trail, which are overcrowded and not adequately maintained. For as long as SciaccheTrail has been a race, two of the most popular SVA trails have been closed entirely. The Via dell’Amore, from Riomaggiore to Manarola, has been closed since September 2012. And the Manarola-Corniglia has been closed since 2010. The National Park does not lack the funds to fix these trails, it just won’t do it!  \\n**The Reasons Behind the Failing Park **  \\n The problems begin with lack of education. Most visitors think that the only trails in Cinque Terre are the coastal trails, because that’s what’s promoted on social media and at Park information booths in each village. There is a[ robust map system online](http://mappe.parconazionale5terre.it/plus/index2.htmlhttp://mappe.parconazionale5terre.it/plus/index2.html), but it’s almost impossible to find on the National Park website. The website mainly just promotes the[ Cinque Terre Card](http://www.parconazionale5terre.it/Ecinque-terre-card.php), which provides trail access, but also train and bus access, and guided tours, but only to the villages and coastal SVA trails.  \\n The tours provided by the Cinque Terre Card are not even managed by the Park; instead,[ A.T.I. 5 Terre](http://www.agenziaviaggi5terre.it/tour-classici/), a consortium of cooperatives that profits off the tours, runs them. The information booths in the villages aren’t managed the Park either, but also by A.T.I. 5 Terre.  \\n It gets worse: there is even a Cinque Terre Card for groups, with a discounted price for groups of 17 or more people. It’s like the Park is there just to promote large private, guided tours of the villages, not the trails.  \\n Even in just the week I was there, it was clear that the employees working the booths at the train stations had no interest or information about the trail network. Multiple employees were confused at my running clothes. They just wanted to sell Cinque Terre Cards.  \\n Meanwhile, out on the actual trails, there are collapsed terrace walls that result in dangerous landslides. Farmers cannot keep up with wall maintenance without help from the Park. It’s the Park’s job to maintain these trails, but historically, there is hardly a trail worker to be seen.  \\n**When a Small Shop Has To Do The Job of an Entire National Park…**  \\n Overtime, the one trekking shop in the region, Cinque Terre Trekking, has become the de facto source of update-to-date trail information. Shop owners, Christine and Nicola, say that they’re constantly answering questions about trail status.  \\n “Often when the coastal SVA trails are closed and the rest of the trails are open (like they are now), tourists come to us saying that they were told at the Park info booth that ‘all of the trails are closed,’” says Christine, aghast at the misinformation shared by Park.  \\n This lack of Park competency is one of the reasons Christine and Nicola were compelled to start SciaccheTrail: to honestly promote the vast trail network of Cinque Terre and to promote sustainable tourism in the form of runners, not cruise ship tourists who come in and leave.  \\n**There Is Hope For a Better Future with President Resasco**  \\n In addition to Cinque Terre Trekking and SciaccheTrail, a there is a new Park President who is committed to saving Cinque Terre trails. Enzo Resasco, who is also the Mayor of villages Vernazza and Corniglia, is dedicated to maintaining the trails and preserving Cinque Terre as we know it. He held a meeting for runners at his office the day before the race, applauding runners and hikers for being sustainable tourists. He literally thanked us for not coming on cruise ships or in big tour groups.  \\n In the week leading up to this year’s SciaccheTrail, multiple terrace walls collapsed, but President Resasco had the trails fixed immediately. In the past, no leader of the Park has ever had such earnest dedication to the trail system. After all, two of the SVA trails have been closed for over six years! President Resasco is hopeful that he can gain enough support within the Park Administration to reopen closed those popular SVA paths, but more importantly, to promote the vast trail network in lieu of large guided tours.  \\n A man well-equipped for the task of improving the Park—he led the seamless rebuilding of Vernazza after a horrific landslide in 2011 leaving the village unrecognizable—Resasco may be the Park’s last hope for serious and permanent change. Trail runners and locals like Christine and Nicola can only do so much. At the end of the day, we need the Park Administration to maintain the trails.  \\n**Should You Go To Cinque Terre?**  \\n Without question, Cinque Terre is a trail runner or hiker’s paradise. If you plan to stay for multiple days, to eat focaccia and to drink Sciacchetra in between long days out on the trails, then you should plan this trip immediately.  \\n But if the National Park continues to promote the tours of the A.T.I. 5 Terre instead of educating tourists about the trails and maintaining the trails, before long, Cinque Terre will lose its charm.  \\n For now though, runners and hikers, Cinque Terre needs us!  \\n    \\n  \\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}",

The summary: New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Minnesota, Colorado Utah, Nevada, Colorado, Venice, Italy, and then all over the Dolomites, which a large mountain range in Italy.  \\n The in-depth version: In the glorious month of June, I spent a whopping three nights in Colorado. So what follows are the other places my feet were fortunate enough to land.\\n\\n### East Coast\\n\\nIn Princeton, New Jersey, I caught up with college friends at an annual reunion. I was reminded of how wonderful East Coast running is, and I even explored the Appalachian Trail for the first time. I ran some extremely rocky miles near the Delaware Water Gap, on the Pennsylvania – New Jersey border.  \\n Then I spent seven consecutive days in seven cities at Patagonia stores touring this moving, motivating and magical film: *[takayna](http://www.patagonia.com/takayna). ** *  \\n At the Patagonia Meatpacking Store in **New York City,** a group and I ran on the West Site Highway, talking trail running, living in the city and how you can still get out to the wild in less than an hour. [Bear Mountain State Park](https://parks.ny.gov/parks/13/details.aspx), people!  \\n In **New Haven, Connecticut,** I learned about the booming trail scene—and ran with a group where two people ran their first 5k ever! The CT trail running scene is raw; there’s a [169 Town Society](http://www.debticonn.org/), which means you’ve run a race in the 169 towns in Connecticut. Along with the growing number of trail runners, there’s a growing push for land conservation and regenerative agriculture. Additionally, organizations like the [Denali Foundation](http://thedenalifoundation.org/) are continuing the charge to get more kids involved in Earth-loving initiatives. After the film screening, I stayed with my wonderful Aunt Jean and Uncle Jim in New London and a took a dip in the icy Thames River before heading back west.\\n\\n### Heading West\\n\\nIn **St. Paul, Minnesota**, I learned that the Mississippi River starts in Minnesota! I also talked about the [Enbridge pipeline, Line 5](https://www.patagonia.com/blog/2016/08/great-lakes-bad-lines/), that the state of Michigan has the power, and *moral duty, *to shut down. So if you live in or care about the Great Lakes Region, [**watch this film**](https://www.patagonia.com/blog/2016/08/great-lakes-bad-lines/)and please, please take action. The Twin Cities also blessed me with a family visit from my wonderful, very athletic second cousins and a new trail running family that’s very convincing that the Superior Fall Trail Race is the most beautiful in the country…  \\n Then at the Patagonia store in **Boulder**, we hosted a packed house of familiar and oh, so friendly faces. Such a respite from my hours in airports. [Wildlands Restoration Volunteers](http://www.wlrv.org/) were in the house, urging Boulderites to join the 3,000 volunteers who’ve helped maintain and restore Boulder, from post-flood efforts to wetlands restoration.\\n\\n### A Fortuitous Encounter\\n\\nEn route to the Patagonia Outlet in **Salt Lake City, Utah**, I met Senator Cory Gardner, *in the flesh. *He was on my flight and I almost passed out, as I think about *him*—how he does and doesn’t do his job on a daily basis. I mustered up the courage mid-flight to ask him about my number one concern for Colorado: the [**Continental Divide Recreation, Wilderness and Camp Hale Legacy Ac**t](https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/27/michael-bennet-jared-polis-continental-divide-recreation-wilderness-and-camp-hale-legacy-act/). He was quick to say that he “cannot support it because the National Guard opposes this bill because of HAATS training. <span class=\\\"s1\\\">As soon as the wording can be worked out, we’ll support it.”</span>  \\n This was frustrating to hear because all of the public knowledge says that the wording of the bill has already been okay-ed by the National Guard. I told Senator Gardner this, but he said he wasn’t aware yet of any approval.  \\n I asked my brother who’s in the military about this reasoning, and he said it’s likely not a problem to choose a different landing area for the [HAATS helicopters](http://www.eaglecounty.us/Airport/General_Aviation/HAATS/), not to mention, Senator Bennet’s office has confirmed the National Guard is not, in fact, opposed to this bill. Senator Gardner using ‘military training’ as a scapegoat for his lack of support, in fact dilutes the importance of actually reserving the reason ‘military training’ when it’s truly necessary! **[I gave Senator Gardner a receipt](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bjx0UZbFoDG/?taken-by=clare_gallagher_runs)** with my same message written down and sat back down. A moot conversation.  \\n But, as I exited the plane, Senator Gardner stepped out of line waiting for his bag,  “You know, I’m not stopping this bill from getting a hearing.” He must have assumed that I don’t understand how bills and hearings work in the Senate. “Yes, I know that.” I paused. “But will you vote for it if it were to get a hearing?” I could tell he was taken aback at my direct question that showed I knew what I was talking about. For if a state wilderness bill doesn’t have support from both of the state’s two senators, how can the rest of the Senate be expected to vote for it? They will look at the consensus within *that state*! So I asked Senator Gardner this, knowing that if he didn’t vote for the bill, he would essentially kill it.  \\n “I’d have to look into it more. Not if it impedes the military training.” I grimaced. “But we would need you to vote for it. And like I said on the plane, according to Senator Bennet’s office, the National Guard doesn’t oppose this bill.” “Okay, well I need to see a statement on that.” I thanked him for his time and walked away.  \\n Needless to say, this encounter riled me up. I’ve been working with [Conservation Colorado](https://conservationco.org/project/protecting-the-continental-divide/) to try to get a statement from the National Guard that says it doesn’t oppose the bill. Why is something so simple, so difficult? In the meantime, I plan to run 200 miles that connects the patches of this bill this fall. In order to showcase these mouth-watering Colorado landscapes, garnering more attention to Senator Gardner’s lack of support. Yes, 200 or so miles. No one said ever said conservation is easy!\\n\\n### Utah\\n\\nAnyways, at the Patagonia SLC store, I learned about a fascinating non-profit called**[Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment](http://uphe.org/)**. This organization spreads awareness about the harmful health effects of pollution. SLC has some of the **[worst air quality](http://kutv.com/news/local/salt-lake-city-has-the-worst-air-quality-in-the-nation)** in the entire country! And to think that the state government is consistently one of the most closed-minded state governments with regards to climate change mitigation—what gives here?  \\n Utah is my neighbor and my playground. I love running and exploring the vast wild places of Utah almost as I love doing the same in Colorado. BUT, I am not going to stay quiet about how long it took for the [Utah government](https://grist.org/article/utah-sobering-up-from-climate-denialism/) to acknowledge climate change, and in turn, how the vast majority of Utah residents are voting. I know there are countless individuals and groups working to make Utah a more progressive and innovative state. But we need more movement from the traditionally conservative constituents. We need more people to *feel *the effects of pollution and to *do more* to change Utah’s approach to climate mitigation.  \\n Check this out for future reference–what strikes as abnormal?  \\n<figure class=\\\"wp-caption alignnone\\\" id=\\\"attachment_1700\\\" style=\\\"width: 899px\\\">![Screen Shot 2018-07-01 at 15.47.26](/content/images/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-01-at-15-47-26.png)<figcaption class=\\\"wp-caption-text\\\">[Yale Program on Climate Change Communications](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&type=value&geo=county)</figcaption></figure>  \\n Also while in SLC, I was called out on a Strava description I posted about a Lyft ride I took to a trailhead. I wanted to run on the amazing SLC trails the morning after I showed the *takayna *film. I wrote something in my run description explaining my complete dismay at how this driver truly believed, “Native Americans wanted Trump to take away that Bears Ears. I hear it on the radio everyday.” I countered him with[**facts**](http://bearsearscoalition.org/category/news/) that disproved this, but he wouldn’t budge.  \\n This conversation, too, became moot. Of course, he was a great driver, I gave him 5-stars and tipped him. He can disagree with me, but what I’m aghast at is the ignorance of facts. Facts about how [large Utah’s outdoor recreation industry](https://outdoorindustry.org/state/utah/) is and facts about what the [5-tribe coalition of Native Americans](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bears-ears-tribes-monument_us_5aaf32b9e4b0337adf851f76) do in fact want: management and federal protection of Bears Ears.  \\n So, if you live in Utah, I encourage you to speak up more. In many ways, your state is ground zero for the spreading of falsities about Native American lands and about the economic powerhouse that is the outdoor recreation industry. I love Utah and I want Utah to be fairly governed and justly protected. And I don’t mean to offend anyone through my storytelling. I elaborated on my Strava description to make the source of my frustration more clear and to ensure I didn’t generalize all Utahans.  \\n But, I will not stop asking questions when I’m traveling, nor will I stop sharing these stories. We need to talk about topics like this more. If I raised some eyebrows, then so be it. Let’s raise more eyebrows in Utah so that SLC could maybe one day not breath such polluted air.\\n\\n### Finishing Up\\n\\nLast stop: Reno, Nevada. I learned about the booming outdoor recreation scene, the local Tesla factory, and the vast trail network from Reno to Tahoe. **The Nevada Conservation League of Voters** showed up, encouraging people to register to vote. I finished my tour feeling inspired.\\n\\n### Starting Up Again\\n\\nI breathed for 48 hours in Colorado and then flew to **Venice, Italy.** After realizing Venice is a collection of tiny raised land masses—not to mention extremely vulnerable to sea level rise!—I headed north to the Dolomites with a team from Patagonia. We hiked to a Refugio—a team of designers, developers, marketing wizards, product people and trail running ambassador, all extremely fit and extremely psyched on making the best trail running products.  \\n I can’t not mention that at Patagonia, it’s never even a question if new products are made with [recycled fabrics like, nylon and polyester](https://www.patagonia.com/recycled-nylon.html). Those fabrics comprise your rain jackets, running shorts, athletic t-shirts, sports bras, to name a few items. I can’t help but ask myself, *When will every brand adopt the value of actually caring about the environment?* As a consumer, you can make a statement by buying gear that’s recycled (and still the best), or better yet, by fixing old gear. Old fashioned consumerism is so old! Patagonia is the trend because it is a *smart *company with more than just gear, it has values. I know I’ve said it before, but I’ll continue to say it: if Patagonia can be ‘all-in,’ we can do with how we consume, conserve, reuse and reduce.  \\n It’s worth mentioning that larger brands who have ‘sustainability’ lines like recycled shoes or recycled plastic bottle tee-shirts, while those are awesome, necessary efforts, these bigger brands aren’t actually making as great of a positive impact as they could be with just *one line*. For these big brands like Nike, adidas, The North Face, Reebok, to make an impact, they should commit the majority of their lines to be made more sustainably. I talked at length about this with some of the Patagonia designers; it’s one of those nuances of ‘sustainability’ that is often overlooked.** **Just another reason where knowing the bigger picture of your products and gear is valuable. Ask more questions!  \\n After a few days of rest at my friend Martina’s home in a small village southeast of Cortina, called Cadore, I was back in the **Dolomites epicenter, Cortina**, giving a talk at the Patagonia store on my running and environmentalism journey. I’ll share my presentation in another blog!\\n\\n### Racing\\n\\nAfter talks, I often have much bigger efforts.[ I raced 74-miles](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkawNySFxIq/?taken-by=clare_gallagher_runs) with 20,000-feet of vertical gain from Friday night into Saturday afternoon in the Lavaredo Ultra Trail. I vomited for the first time ever in a race. I sprained my ankle repeatedly, lost vision in my left eye, lost liquid out of my backend, couldn’t eat, tried to smile through the ‘shit,’ and finished 9<sup>th</sup>. I achieved my ultimate goal of finishing because to be honest, I questioned whether I would do Lavaredo. Only a month after [World Championships](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiuIuJegZ3s/?taken-by=clare_gallagher_runs) and with my travel schedule, it was difficult to get proper training in. Regardless, my ultimate goal is to race UTMB at the end of the summer, and I needed this 5-point race.  \\n I recovered back at Martina’s place in Cadore, and gave another talk at an **[Adventure Outdoor Festival](http://www.mountainblog.eu/clare-gallagher-trail-runner-care-about-environment/)** in a town close to the Austrian border, called San Candido. I’m dealing with a knee injury from smashing my patella on an iron cable from a via ferrata (iron rope climb) in the week after my race. Embarrassing to have injured myself *after *my race, but alas, I’m only human.\\n\\n### Goals\\n\\nSo after all of this, I’m quite ready to be home. I wish I could say home in Boulder is a peaceful oasis of pure recovery. It’s close, but not quite. This week, I’ll be moving for the 8<sup>th</sup> time in 12 months. I bring these frequent moves upon myself, as I make rash decisions quite frequently about relationships and about what’s convenient. Moving this many times, along with my travel schedule, hasn’t been conducive to my ultimate goal: to get more people to give a crap about our [sick planet](https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/al-gore-calls-record-breaking-heat-ominous/ar-AAzqK03)**.** She needs us more than ever. And before I can ever feel even the slightest bit productive with this goal, I am learning that first I must take care of myself better by valuing recovery more.

I gave\nSenator Gardner a receipt\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/Bjx0UZbFoDG/?taken-by=clare_gallagher_runs]  with\nmy same message written down and sat back down. A moot conversation.\nBut, as I exited the plane, Senator Gardner stepped out of line waiting for his\nbag,  “You know, I’m not stopping this bill from getting a hearing.” He must\nhave assumed that I don’t understand how bills and hearings work in the Senate.\n“Yes, I know that.” I paused. “But will you vote for it if it were to get a\nhearing?” I could tell he was taken aback at my direct question that showed I\nknew what I was talking about. For if a state wilderness bill doesn’t have\nsupport from both of the state’s two senators, how can the rest of the Senate be\nexpected to vote for it? They will look at the consensus within that state! So I\nasked Senator Gardner this, knowing that if he didn’t vote for the bill, he\nwould essentially kill it.\n“I’d have to look into it more. Not if it impedes the military training.” I\ngrimaced. “But we would need you to vote for it. And like I said on the plane,\naccording to Senator Bennet’s office, the National Guard doesn’t oppose this\nbill.” “Okay, well I need to see a statement on that.” I thanked him for his\ntime and walked away.\nNeedless to say, this encounter riled me up. I’ve been working with \nConservation\nColorado [https://conservationco.org/project/protecting-the-continental-divide/] \n to try to get a statement from the National Guard that says it doesn’t oppose\nthe bill. Why is something so simple, so difficult? In the meantime, I plan to\nrun 200 miles that connects the patches of this bill this fall. In order to\nshowcase these mouth-watering Colorado landscapes, garnering more attention to\nSenator Gardner’s lack of support. Yes, 200 or so miles. No one said ever said\nconservation is easy!\n\nUtah\nAnyways, at the Patagonia SLC store, I learned about a fascinating non-profit\ncalled**Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment [http://uphe.org/]**. This\norganization spreads awareness about the harmful health effects of pollution.\nSLC has some of the worst air quality\n[http://kutv.com/news/local/salt-lake-city-has-the-worst-air-quality-in-the-nation] \n in the entire country! And to think that the state government is consistently\none of the most closed-minded state governments with regards to climate change\nmitigation—what gives here?\nUtah is my neighbor and my playground. I love running and exploring the vast\nwild places of Utah almost as I love doing the same in Colorado. BUT, I am not\ngoing to stay quiet about how long it took for the Utah government\n[https://grist.org/article/utah-sobering-up-from-climate-denialism/]  to\nacknowledge climate change, and in turn, how the vast majority of Utah residents\nare voting. I know there are countless individuals and groups working to make\nUtah a more progressive and innovative state. But we need more movement from the\ntraditionally conservative constituents. We need more people to *feel *the\neffects of pollution and to do more  to change Utah’s approach to climate\nmitigation.\nCheck this out for future reference–what strikes as abnormal?\n\n![Screen Shot 2018-07-01 at\n15.47.26](/content/images/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-01-at-15-47-26.png)\n[Yale Program on Climate Change\nCommunications](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2016/?est=happening&type=value&geo=county) \n \nAlso while in SLC, I was called out on a Strava description I posted about a\nLyft ride I took to a trailhead. I wanted to run on the amazing SLC trails the\nmorning after I showed the *takayna *film. I wrote something in my run\ndescription explaining my complete dismay at how this driver truly believed,\n“Native Americans wanted Trump to take away that Bears Ears. I hear it on the\nradio everyday.” I countered him\nwith[**facts**](http://bearsearscoalition.org/category/news/) that disproved\nthis, but he wouldn’t budge. \nThis conversation, too, became moot. Of course, he was a great driver, I gave\nhim 5-stars and tipped him. He can disagree with me, but what I’m aghast at is\nthe ignorance of facts. Facts about how [large Utah’s outdoor recreation\nindustry](https://outdoorindustry.org/state/utah/) is and facts about what the\n[5-tribe coalition of Native\nAmericans](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bears-ears-tribes-monument_us_5aaf32b9e4b0337adf851f76)\ndo in fact want: management and federal protection of Bears Ears. \nSo, if you live in Utah, I encourage you to speak up more. In many ways, your\nstate is ground zero for the spreading of falsities about Native American lands\nand about the economic powerhouse that is the outdoor recreation industry. I\nlove Utah and I want Utah to be fairly governed and justly protected. And I\ndon’t mean to offend anyone through my storytelling. I elaborated on my Strava\ndescription to make the source of my frustration more clear and to ensure I\ndidn’t generalize all Utahans. \nBut, I will not stop asking questions when I’m traveling, nor will I stop\nsharing these stories. We need to talk about topics like this more. If I raised\nsome eyebrows, then so be it. Let’s raise more eyebrows in Utah so that SLC\ncould maybe one day not breath such polluted air.Finishing Up\nLast stop: Reno, Nevada. I learned about the booming outdoor recreation scene,\nthe local Tesla factory, and the vast trail network from Reno to Tahoe. The\nNevada Conservation League of Voters  showed up, encouraging people to register\nto vote. I finished my tour feeling inspired.\n\nStarting Up Again\nI breathed for 48 hours in Colorado and then flew to Venice, Italy.  After\nrealizing Venice is a collection of tiny raised land masses—not to mention\nextremely vulnerable to sea level rise!—I headed north to the Dolomites with a\nteam from Patagonia. We hiked to a Refugio—a team of designers, developers,\nmarketing wizards, product people and trail running ambassador, all extremely\nfit and extremely psyched on making the best trail running products.\nI can’t not mention that at Patagonia, it’s never even a question if new\nproducts are made with recycled fabrics like, nylon and polyester\n[https://www.patagonia.com/recycled-nylon.html]. Those fabrics comprise your\nrain jackets, running shorts, athletic t-shirts, sports bras, to name a few\nitems. I can’t help but ask myself, When will every brand adopt the value of\nactually caring about the environment? As a consumer, you can make a statement\nby buying gear that’s recycled (and still the best), or better yet, by fixing\nold gear. Old fashioned consumerism is so old! Patagonia is the trend because it\nis a smart company with more than just gear, it has values. I know I’ve said it\nbefore, but I’ll continue to say it: if Patagonia can be ‘all-in,’ we can do\nwith how we consume, conserve, reuse and reduce.\nIt’s worth mentioning that larger brands who have ‘sustainability’ lines like\nrecycled shoes or recycled plastic bottle tee-shirts, while those are awesome,\nnecessary efforts, these bigger brands aren’t actually making as great of a\npositive impact as they could be with just one line. For these big brands like\nNike, adidas, The North Face, Reebok, to make an impact, they should commit the\nmajority of their lines to be made more sustainably. I talked at length about\nthis with some of the Patagonia designers; it’s one of those nuances of\n‘sustainability’ that is often overlooked. **Just another reason where knowing\nthe bigger picture of your products and gear is valuable. Ask more questions!\nAfter a few days of rest at my friend Martina’s home in a small village\nsoutheast of Cortina, called Cadore, I was back in the Dolomites epicenter,\nCortina, giving a talk at the Patagonia store on my running and environmentalism\njourney. I’ll share my presentation in another blog!\n\nRacing\nAfter talks, I often have much bigger efforts.  I raced 74-miles\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/BkawNySFxIq/?taken-by=clare_gallagher_runs]  with\n20,000-feet of vertical gain from Friday night into Saturday afternoon in the\nLavaredo Ultra Trail. I vomited for the first time ever in a race. I sprained my\nankle repeatedly, lost vision in my left eye, lost liquid out of my backend,\ncouldn’t eat, tried to smile through the ‘shit,’ and finished 9th. I achieved my\nultimate goal of finishing because to be honest, I questioned whether I would do\nLavaredo. Only a month after World Championships\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/BiuIuJegZ3s/?taken-by=clare_gallagher_runs]  and\nwith my travel schedule, it was difficult to get proper training in. Regardless,\nmy ultimate goal is to race UTMB at the end of the summer, and I needed this\n5-point race.\nI recovered back at Martina’s place in Cadore, and gave another talk at an \nAdventure Outdoor Festival\n[http://www.mountainblog.eu/clare-gallagher-trail-runner-care-about-environment/] \n in a town close to the Austrian border, called San Candido. I’m dealing with a\nknee injury from smashing my patella on an iron cable from a via ferrata (iron\nrope climb) in the week after my race. Embarrassing to have injured myself\n*after *my race, but alas, I’m only human.\n\nGoals\nSo after all of this, I’m quite ready to be home. I wish I could say home in\nBoulder is a peaceful oasis of pure recovery. It’s close, but not quite. This\nweek, I’ll be moving for the 8th  time in 12 months. I bring these frequent\nmoves upon myself, as I make rash decisions quite frequently about relationships\nand about what’s convenient. Moving this many times, along with my travel\nschedule, hasn’t been conducive to my ultimate goal: to get more people to give\na crap about our sick planet\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/al-gore-calls-record-breaking-heat-ominous/ar-AAzqK03]\n.  She needs us more than ever. And before I can ever feel even the slightest\nbit productive with this goal, I am learning that first I must take care of\nmyself better by valuing recovery more. So, here’s to the rest of an earthraging\nsummer.",
